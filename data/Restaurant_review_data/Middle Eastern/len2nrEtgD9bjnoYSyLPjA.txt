We started with a small hummus plate which is served with fresh pita_ The pitas are served on fresh pita bread and the meat is juicy, tender, and delicious! The customer service is great as well! Nice friendly staff and prompt service_ We will be back to try their baklava!',)("I would not recommend this place_ I've had two bad experiences in the past and one of which happened today_ I'm a busy person so I don't have time to dine in_ I ordered to go_ Specifically said I would like to order calamari to go_ The person who answered my phone said small or large? I said large_ I was told my order will be ready in 10 minutes_ I have someone pick it up for me under my name and I get hummus with pita bread, which is not what I ordered_ I call Sabas and they tell me there's no order for calamari anywhere_ I reorder over the phone and come to the restaurant myself_ They hand me a small box of calamari_ I ask if they have a large dish, one of the guys says no, it's a one size_ I was just asked over the phone if I wanted a small or large dish so this confused me_ But I accept it and leave_ 8_ for this small box of calamari was not an issue, it was the quality of that calamari once I started eating it_ Looked soggy, and tasted like a rubber band_ I have to work tonight and I'm praying that I don't get food poisoning_ The first time I ordered gyros, I was not pleased_ I can't recall if they ever messed up that order too, but I remember not getting enough of the gyro meat_ The best places with gyros are Greek Pita and Chicago Gyros_ This is not the place_ I don't know why there's so much hype about this place_ I've been to many restaurants and I'm not pleased with this one_ But I don't know what their dining experience is like since I've never had one, I just know don't order takeout from this place_",)("Saba's is just so good_ This is a place we order from every month to two months and we always end up saying _that was a good idea_ after stuffing our faces_ I am pretty positive that we have explored most of the menu and have never been disappointed_ I will always choose to support local businesses first and this place is a gem!",)("I picked up dinner from here last night_  Although the food was ready in the time promised and the people there are nice; I thought the food was just eh'_  My group of 4 ordered about _60 worth of food so we were able to try a bunch of different things_  Everything from the hummus to the gyro was just ok_\n\nWould I go back to Saba's?  Yes_  Do I want to go back?  Not really_",)("I've been enjoying Saba's for year and find their food delicious and very consistent_ I also love the family atmosphere-all the employees are related_ They are pleasant and friendly and I often see them on  the news,  making their great recipes! My family and extended family are all hooked on this wonderful food_ However I have a question, I ordered take out several weeks ago and everything tasted different! The gyro meat was spiced differently, the tzatziki sauce tasted totally different then their norm and I didn't recognize any employees! Strange I thought-was the restaurant sold? Do they just have new recipes? The food was still tasty but not what I'm used to after frequenting the restaurant for 10 years! Also, when I picked  up my order it wasn't ready, evidently it was never submitted so I had to wait another 20 minutes! This would of never happened previously_ Will somebody please tell me what's going on with the ownership of this establishment!",)("I just love the Tiramisu here_ I don't eat beef and after coming to know that the same oil is used for frying Falafel and beef has disappointed me_ I wish restaurants had a separate frying option for vegetarian food_",)('Good food_ Although unimpressed by the quantity_ Pita was cold when served_ Shrimps seemed a tad undercooked for my taste_ Overall an average experience_',)("There are three things Saba's does undoubtedly right_ Firstly, their gyros; they are great and some versions are very unique like their buffalo gyro! Next up would be their fries_ They are cooked perfectly and are firm and crispy on the outside yet warm and mushy on the inside (I love my fries like that)_ Lastly, their lemon rice soup_ Let me stress that everyone, unless they're either repulsed by or deathly allergic to lemons, needs to try a cup of this soup! I remember when I used to come here and it was only served on Thursdays and Fridays_ Lately it has become so popular that Saba's serves it every day (That should say something)_ \n\nEverything else that I've tried at Saba's has been good but the three above mentioned items are great and my favorites_ They are what keep me coming back and should really be considered for anyone visiting this restaurant_",)("This has always been one of my favorite places, and I swear our last visit it was even better than it's ever been_ Their meat is so tender, their sauces and dips so flavorful, the service is always friendly and it feels like the best (un)kept secret in Phoenix_ I highly recommend the baba ganoush, sleepy gyro salad, and lemon shrimp gyro_ Seriously some of the best food I've ever had_ I've yet to find another Mediterranean restaurant in the Valley_",)("This place was fantastic!  I have been searching for an authentic Mediterranean place for a while now and have come up less than impressed_  Saba's totally changed that though!  Fantastic food, great customer service, the staff was so friendly and helpful_  They have items on the menu I haven't seen at other places that I've been craving!  It was a little hard to find for some of the people who were meeting us there but once there everyone was very pleased with the results!  Thank you Saba's for adding to my _I will be back_ list!",)("Oh so Good! \nThe food is absolutely amazing_ There are so many good things on the menu; it's hard to not over order_\nThe service was great_ Quite possibly the best service we've had at a restaurant in a long time_\nBy far the best Greek food we've had in the Phoenix metro area_",)('This is one of my favorite go-to spots fo Mediterranean food_ Super fresh, tasty and authentic with very large portions and great variety_',)('Fantastic chicken food and service_ Mediterranean yes nailed it coming from a foodie!',)('We are hard to please and coming from Chicago with several great Gyros restaurants we visit we saw _Chicago Gyros_ and said why not_ Underwhelmed_ The portion of meat was small and tziki sauce was very light and tasted much of wine vinegar_ We may try other menu items as the place was fairly busy_',)("Before seeing a concert at the musical instrument museum not far from here, I picked up a falafel pita sandwich from here___ let me tell you_  So good_  The falafel here has that perfect crackly exterior texture that I'm so picky about and just perfectly seasoned_  And they are super fast if you are in a rush and just picking up_",)('I knew that I was going to be in the area and I wanted a Gyros salad_  So hit went to Yelp to find me a spot_  I am so happy that I found this place_  I have to admit that this was probably one of the best Greek Salads that I have ever had_  Also it was huge and priced just right_  I will defiantly be back the next time I am in this part of town_',)('Great food! Glad to see a patio and the bar menu now has cocktails_ The staff is fun and easy going_ Love  the spicy shrimp gyro and the beat chipotle hummus_',)("Came here for a casual night out_ The food is authentic and tasty! We've done a few trips to the Peloponnese area of Greece - Stoupa, Kalamata, Kardimilli and the salads and gyros here are just as good_  The meats are well seasoned and delicious_ The pitas fresh and soft_ Yummy tsatziki and hummus_ And they have Mythos beer which is usually hard to find_ Friendly service and good value_",)('Love the lamb shank and spicy feta fries!
