The food: Excellent_ The Staff: Hard working and attentive_ The owner: Very Friendly and Cordial_ \n\nWe had a large party of over ten people, and while I wish there had been a bit more available on the menu the night we came, our experience was very pleasant_ They even gave us a free plate of food after they made mistake on one of our orders_ \n\nI highly recommend this gem of a restaurant and it's kosher!

Can't wait to come back! Chicken shawarma is juicy and seasoned to perfection_  Falafel, schnitzel, beef kabobs, were so great_  Sides r tasty!

The schwarma was even worse_ The chicken was super greasy, over cooked and not very tasty_ The plate came with no veggies and was literally an expensive pile of meat_ \n\nThe meal was very disappointing!",)("Paprika absolutely rocks_ The shawarma is incredible, especially with a bit of shug over it__ and on the hummus_ Plenty of food if you order a plate_ Order a lafa and you will need to split it_ Kosher, so the quality is extremely high_ And the pricing is dead on, as well_ Just a little bit northwest of the Scottsdale_Shea intersection, you cannot go wrong with Paprika_ Haven't tried the ribeye, but it looked fantastic_ Israeli salad, eggplant, baba ghanoush are all here_ You should be too!",)('The chicken shwarma was moist however, the Lafa portion is too large for one person_ The falafel taste was great but the batch was slightly over-fried_ However, this place is good for a quick lunch_',)("Ok I'm kind of obsessed with this place!
