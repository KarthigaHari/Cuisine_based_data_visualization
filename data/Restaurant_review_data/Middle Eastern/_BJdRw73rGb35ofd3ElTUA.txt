I make pretty good rice but theirs is the best I've ever had_ Basmanti, each grain separate and exquisitely flavorful with subtle spices_  I don't usually think of rice as the star of the meal, but this rice is amazing_  The hummus was lovely and the baba ghanoush the best I've ever had_ Again, perfectly balanced delicate spices_  I had the gyro plate and look forward to the goat, the lamb and the biryani_  Can hardly wait to visit again!  Oh, and the staff are very warm and friendly_",)('My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in Tempe with great customer service_',)('I was really disappointed_ First and foremost--this place was very dirty_ Carpets desperately needed to be vacuumed between customers_ Desperately need to get the carpets professionally cleaned as well_ Found hair on the tables_ People also felt free to walk across tables on the ground since their shoes were off_ Second, food was good but half of the meat (lamb mandi) was all fat_ Rice did not seem fresh_ We went on a Friday night so everything should have been on point_ We definitely wont go back_ Friendly service_',)('Excellent service!  Great food!  Fun atmosphere!  We will definitely be back!  Try the gyros and the goat mandi!  Absolutely delicious!',)("I cannot stress how excellent the food is here!  I got the goat rice and it's one of the best goat rices that I've had_  The goat itself was tender, flavorful, and fell right off the bone_  The rice was very flavorful and didn't get old_  The sauces were just the right amount of spiciness and flavor to add to the dish without becoming overwhelming_  I'm seriously champing at the bit to go back to this restaurant_",)('First time yesterday, loved chicken mandi and fahsa, they also offer a variety of Arabic beverages',)('Greek delivered to the door, for that they get 3 stars_ Food was not very good, the gyro meat did not appear to be shaved off the spit, rather Prepackaged like something out of a grocery store_',)('Great food !!! \n\nthe lamp is delicious_ \n\nThe best middleeasren food in Tempe __\nI recommend it to everyone ___ Perfect , clean , awesome staff ,and friendly ___ \n\n\nLOve it sooo much',)("The only thing that I ever get here is the goat, lamb mendi or a combo of both_ The lamb is amazing, it simply falls off the bone_ I will probably try other things on the menu but for now I'm content_ I recommend anyone that like lamb or goat to give this place a try_ I've made this regular stop every couple weeks_",)("This place has goat on rice the same way they serve it in the Middle East and they don't waste ice by putting it in your water this place is very authentic",)('If you like baba ghanoush then you will LOVE this one! Best baba I have ever had! From the texture to the subtle seasoning then right into the little bits of garlic___Yummmmmm! Definately on my favorite places list_',)("Isn't it great when you find food from Yemen all the way in the valley? I sure felt glad! \nHaving lived in Dubai all my life, I grew up fond of this kind of food, Mandi, Mathbi, Madfoon, Bukhari, etc_ Yemeni and Saudi food in Dubai was and still is very popular and is known for delicious taste, huge portions, and very reasonable (sometimes even cheap) prices_ \nWe were referred to this restaurant by a family member_ Not sure how she found out about it bcz she never tried it so far but we, my husband and I, decided to give it a shot and head there_ We arrived at around 12:45pm_ We expected to find some people when we walked in but it was empty_ Not a problem_ The first thing that I would say is probably the only major negative in this place is the smell_ My husband was about to take me some where else bcz I was getting uncomfortable_ As you walk in, you are hit with a strong smell of cleaning chemicals that do not smell good at all_ I am not sure what the reason is but I decided to just ignore the smell and order and go in as soon as possible bcz the smell was mostly only at the entrance_ \nI ordered the goat mandi and my husband ordered the lamb with rice dish_ We were asked to pick a seat either on the table or in the traditional Arabic section and they would bring out the food_ We also were offered to get our drinks from the fridge_ \nWe decided to sit in the Arabic Jalsa area since there was no one there_ The food came out in a reasonable time - about 10 min and it looked great_ The meat was in the center of the dish with some browned onions on top, both dishes looked very inviting_ The food was served with a lime wedge, some cucumber yogurt and a green chili sauce on the side_ We dug in and the food was delicious! I was so glad at that point that my husband did not insist on making us leave and that I was able to survive the entrance and try this good food_ The meat was delicious and very tender and the rice was cooked to perfection_ Portion size as always in these restaurants was just right_ Having not had breakfast, I finished my dish and of course my husband did too_ \nAfter eating this great meal we left feeling drowsy lool, a typical feeling after you have such a good big rice meal  \nWe paid at the entrance just before we left and the price was _39 for 2 dishes and 2 drinks_ Slightly on the expensive side but not too bad_ \nI hope they will find a solution for the smell in this place because the food and the service are so good, it would be a shame if ppl decide not to come in because of that_",)("Best Falafel in town_ \n\nThe chef said he grids it himself in house_ The flavor, was robust and full of garlic_ The peta bread and romaine lettuce in the pita were nothing special the sprinkling of aleppo pepper was a nice touch_ \n\nThe first thing you will notice when you walk in for lunch is 1_ an amazing aroma of spices 2_ a pile of cushions from dinner, don't worry they are open 3_ a empty counter (don't worry they are making food and will get to you)\n\nI can not wait to go back and try other dishes, which will be hard as the alure of the falafel is making my mouth water and filling my dreams as I write thing",)('It was delicious - super flavorful! I had the goat meat with rice and salad delivered to my office_ Everyone was jealous!',)
