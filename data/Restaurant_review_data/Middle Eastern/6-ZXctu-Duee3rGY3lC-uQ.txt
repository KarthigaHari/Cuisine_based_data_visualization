Then on closer inspection of the kebab platter noted it came with only two skewers instead of three as noted in the menu_ \n\n At first when we asked the server it was as if nothing happened_  However when we pointed out the discrepancy by pointing out to the menu, they indicated that they ran out of kebabs so gave us only two_   Oh well that certainly did not sit well with us_  They did apologize a few times, but that was after the fact of bringing it to the attention and brought us the missing kebab_   Both menu items were OK and lacked flavor_\n\nThankfully we came with a Groupon_  We certainly hoped for a better experience as it seemed like a nice family restaurant, but will not be returning here_',)("Tried this hole in the wall place tonight after finding a coupon in the entertainment coupon book, and it was so awesome_ I'm so glad we discovered it!
