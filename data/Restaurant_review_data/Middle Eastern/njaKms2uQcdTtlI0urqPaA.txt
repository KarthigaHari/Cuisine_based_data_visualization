('Great food with authentic flavor, had the chicken couscous which was awesome and my girlfriend had the fish tajine, we enjoyed the food very much and will come back soon for more_',)("The staff is extremely rude and unorganized! I have never been so disappointed! The location is uncleanly and doesn't smell good at all_ The restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap_ To top it off the food was prepared with no gloves_ I recommend not going here EVER!!",)('This restaurant_market_clothing store is highly overrated!  It is located in a seedy little strip mall in a not-so-great part of town_  We ordinarily love little joints like this and avoid chain restaurants at all costs_  This one, however, did not impress us_  The owner is very nice but, since we were the only ones there it should not have taken over an hour to get our food_  We walked around the small market while waiting and found the meat and vegetables very unappealing and the canned goods looked like they had been there for a long time_  Some of the bags of food were so sticky we recoiled when touching them_  Someone came in for a carryout order that had been preordered and paid for and even that took an additional 20-30 minutes after they arrived_  We thought the prices were on the high side for the type of place it is and the lack of ambiance - and, to top it off, we did not receive a check and had to stand by the register while the owner added it up and verbally gave us the total which we realized later was about _8_00 more than the menu prices for our two entrees and tea_ We would not have added a 20% gratuity if we had known we were overcharged in the first place_ All in all it was not an experience we would care to repeat_',)("Alzohour Market is a prime example of the recommendation not to judge a book by its cover_  It has the (rightful) appearance of a store, where you could buy Halal meats, canned goods and clothing, but there is really nothing to suggest it being a restaurant except for the few tables and chairs_  While the store is quite large, the amount of space dedicated to the dining area isn't and this is a shame_\n\nAlzohour Market is a _mom-n-pop_ shop, the husband being from Morocco; the wife being Syrian  (I asked, because there was a fairly wide selection of Bosnian items on the shelves -- as is the case in several Middle Eastern shops in the Valley -- and also, because there was at least one Bosnian dish on the menu)_  Their respective heritages are readily reflected in the food, which, at times, may be somewhat different than what you're used to in Middle Eastern food_\n\nWe started out with the hummus and babaganoush as appetizers_  For the prices they charge, the portions were more than acceptable_  While neither was typical of similar dishes we've had in the Valley (the hummus came with a variety of vegetables garnishing it and the babaganoush had onions and was somewhat 'gelatinous'), both were very tasty and neither of us had any complaints about either (except a difference of opinion as to which was tastier)_\n\nMy partner then had an order of cheese pie and one of meat_  While the wife part of the team (part chef; part waiter; and part marathon runner) stated the cheese pie would be like a _burek_, it really wasn't (but that's irrelevant)_  At _2_99 each, the sizes of each were good and could easily have sufficed as either an appetizer or even a meal in itself  (in fact, after splitting the hummus and babaganoush, and then having these two pies, my partner was -- amazingly -- full ___ no mean accomplishment, if you've read my other reviews and know how much of a glutton we both are_  That nevertheless did not stop him from helping me polish off my entree and half a dessert)_  The cheese in the cheese pie is a bit salty, so if you're not a fan of salty foods, be advised_  The meat pie looks like a flat, pita-pizza and, in itself, is not very substantial_\n\nI had the lamb tangine for my main entree and was pleasantly surprised ___ especially as its no easy feat to find variety in a Middle Eastern restaurant out here_  The lamb was succulent and almost fell off the bone_  The stewed prunes and toasted almonds complimented the lamb splendidly and the sauce was finger-lickin' good  (yes, I had washed my hands beforehand)_  Like most Middle Eastern restaurants, the lamb was served with way too much saffron rice, which, while very good, is something no diabetic should be tempted with! :-)\n\nThough we were quite full  -- and glad we had hit the gym prior to coming here -- the owner recommended the Kunafa for dessert ___ and it was a wise recommendation_  We've had this before in another restaurant in the Valley_  It was served cold there and I was not particularly impressed_  This time, it was served quite hot and the crushed pistachios and orange-blossom water really contributed to its wonderful taste_\n\nIn my opinion, were the owners to shut down the store part of this place, do some decorating and hire some waitstaff, this place could easily become a very decent Middle Eastern restaurant in its own right and provide some much welcome competition to other places in the Valley_  The minor discomforts of eating in a store, where the restaurant is not the main draw, should be overlooked this time_  It's quite worth it_",)("Fabulous food_ The owner is terrific_  You won't be disappointed_ We drove 40 miles and will do it again_ We tried four dishes and the were all delicious_",)('A neighborhood ethnic place in yet another ubiquitous strip mall_ I thought the food was good and the owners charming_ I had the lamb shank with vegetables and cous cous_ I thought is was good not great_ It needed more seasoning and I relied on some red spicy sauce we all passed around to give it dimension_ If I am ever in that neck of the woods again, I would definitely try one of the tangines_ \nWe need to support places like this and enjoy the diversity in our neighborhoods!',)("We had been in Morocco earlier in the year_ My wife's birthday was a reason to celebrate and to relive part of the trip___the food  here was better  than in Casablanca_  Just surrender to the menu, ask for guidance and you will have a wonderful dining experience__The low ambiance is off set by great food and hospitality_ We will be back often_",)("Really, I can describe this place only in superlatives_ I've been here multiple times now, and it has never disappointed_ Everything is cooked fresh, the flavors blend beautifully, and the owner is pleasant and informative_",)("Food is totally awesome_ The owner is great too, the only issue is that since she does everything, it's possible it takes forever to get service_\n\nRestaurant, Clothing Store, and Grocery_",)("A friend and I shared a chicken  bastilla here and loved it_ Along with its companion salad, it would easily have served three, maybe four lunchers_ Our second lunch buddy had the Bosnian sausage, served with sour cream but not avjar, which pretty well matched that of the Sarajevo Cafe but was not quite as savory (perhaps less fatty, which for us is actually a good thing)_ Service was leisurely, but we expected that_ So, all good, though I wish they had divided up the salad and maybe the bastilla on individual plates (tables are small and the ensuing plate clutter was significant) and offered our friend both sour cream and the peppery red sauce (avjar) that would have made the sausages more complex and delicious_ Other than that, no complaints at all about the food_ Can't wait to return for another bastilla_ \n\nI can't speak for the scope of the market, but I did find some interesting items and did not find their prices out of line, considering how small the operation is_ Enjoyed seeing the colorful clothing, at least some of which is apparently sewn on site_ \n\nMy friends and I lunch weekly and seldom repeat a restaurant, but we agreed this one is a keeper for all of us_",)('I had dinner there tonight_ The food is great_ I tried Bastilla and it was amazing_ The owner is very nice but she needs some help_ She needs to hire a nice looking waitress to help her out_ Anyway, the Bastilla is a little sweet but taste wonderful_ If you go there be sure to try the Kinafeh is it something pretty good and you will never forget it_ The owner is a Moroccan lady , she had a beautiful face without any enhancement_\nI will recommend this place to everybody I know_',)("This meal was like nothing I've ever had before - I've had Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine at a number of places but this was my first time trying Moroccan food_ The entrees were superb and very generously portioned - we shared the lamb tagine and the bastilla_ Such rich and complex flavors and an interesting combination of savory and sweet, just absolutely delicious_ Also had the best stuffed grape leaves I've ever had (served warm, which I really liked because they tasted so freshly made)_\n\n Service was friendly and pretty quick, it's a one woman operation so I expected I'd be pretty slow but there was only one other group of diners there so I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly our food came out_\n\nI highly recommend checking this place out, it exceeded my expectations_ You won't be disappointed!",)("I may very well have found the perfect dish to satisfy those who want to eat dinner and dessert all at once_  And while I was at it, I discovered a truly multifaceted local business_  I've already sung the praises of Habbouz, a local restaurant serving up delicious food with a primary focus on Tunisian cuisine (as of this moment the only restaurant in town with this emphasis as far as I'm aware)_  Right next door to Habbouz is a restaurant, with hard to find Middle Eastern groceries as well as a Middle Eastern clothing boutique all in one spot_  There really is no place in town quite like Alzohour Market_  And there's no dish I've ever tried quite like the Bastilla_\n\nOriginally opened in 2003, Alzohour is the brainchild of owner Zhor Saad_  Originally from Morocco, Zhor opened the market first and foremost as a grocery store and clothing boutique_  The clothing boutique on the south side of the business contains a variety of cultural clothing for men and women and in fact I saw a couple of Muslim families shopping at the boutique during my visit here_  The grocery store is on the north side of the business space and contains a variety of dry and cold grocery items as well as a deli counter that backs up to the main kitchen_  In the middle is the sit down restaurant, which Saad added to the space in 2008_  The restaurant portion seats maybe 20 people and the entire business was operated by three people on the day I was here, with Zhor herself running the show_   \n\nI came here on a Saturday after attending a rally in support of the local Muslim community at the Islamic Community Center just down the street_  A number of Muslim families and supporters made their way here afterwards so I figured I'd give it a go_  Another driver of me coming here was an article I'd seen about Alzohour by renowned Arizona Republic food critic Dominic Armato_  In one of his _Killer Dish_ articles, Dominic sung the praises of Alzohour's most complex dish of all_  The Bastilla_  In fact there's actually a video on AZCentral that shows all the ingredients and the process Zhor Saad uses to make this dish_  But there were other pleasant surprises in addition to the Bastilla_\n\nWhen I arrived, Zhor very kindly sat me down at one of the corner tables_  As I knew what I was getting for my main course (and I was starving), I ordered my Bastilla right away and also decided to give a glass of their mango juice a try as well_  First though, the house salad, which you get with your entree as a starter_  The salad was a delightful mix of greens, olive oil, pita chips, tomatoes, and even some cucumber mixed in_  Nice and cold, but with a smooth finish each time thanks to the olive oil_  The mango juice was also a very pleasant accompaniment_  Not too sweet, not too acidic_  Just a smooth fruity drink to wake up my palette_  \n\nAnd then, at last, the main event_  The Bastilla_  The ingredient list for this dish is so long it would rival a Mexican Mole' recipe so check out the AZCentral article I referenced for the full rundown_  But basically we're talking about chicken and almonds that have been mixed with a ton of different ingredients, which is then cooked into a filo dough pie and doused with tons of cinnamon and powdered sugar_  The size of this dish was quite imposing when it arrived at my table_  But that first bite, wow_  A veritable cornucopia of different flavors swirl in your mouth with every bite_  You get the sweet notes from the cinnamon and sugar (both on top as well as cooked into the chicken), along with the savory notes of the chicken, saffron, cilantro and a number of other ingredients_  The volume of chicken in this dish was quite surprising and such that there's no way I could've finished this all by myself so I had to take some home_  In any event it's abundantly clear to me why Armato marked this dish as Alzohour's calling card_  I've never eaten anything quite like it_\n\nTotal cost for the salad, Bastilla, mango juice drink, tax and tip came to about _30_  I'd noticed a number of people who'd previously reviewed this business on Yelp docked it for poor or unreliable service_  I experienced nothing of the sort today_  Zhor was extremely friendly and attentive to me even with 6 other customers dining in_  Considering its just her and one or two other people working in the kitchen, the amount of food, quality of the food, and relatively short period of time they're cranking out the food is quite impressive_  By the way, you'll want to order the hot tea here sometime_  Zhor puts on an impressive show with the tea you have to see for yourself_  Great food, great owner, great find_  What a treat_",)("Moroccan food in Phoenix? What? How had I been working a mile down the street for a year and a half without trying this place?\n\nWell, I finally stopped by_ It's a little confusing when you walk in, because it's really a small operation___ Didn't know whether to just pick a table, or let the lady working there seat me, or what_ But once I got situated, things started getting a little more relaxed_\n\nThe menu is impressive indeed, with a good six or seven dishes that were all calling my name_ I ended up opting for the lamb tangine with soup and rice, and the lemonade_ The lemonade is as good as any delicious lemonade you'll find at a Mediterranean place, by which I mean it actually tastes kinda like lemon_  I like that they make it a little tart - the same way they do it at my favorite Lebanese places_\n\nThe soup was a tomato based soup with carrots, chickpeas, lentils, spices, and possibly some other things_ It's OK, I'm not a huge fan of that kind of soup, but it went down nicely, even on a 110 degree day_\n\nOf course the tangine was what I was looking forward to most - the only way I can describe it is succulent_ The lamb is fall-off-the-bone tender, and presumably cooked in the clay pot after which it is named, along with some figs and an aromatic sauce_ \n\nTo complete the meal, I had some baklava for dessert_ I figured I might as well try it, since I hadn't had baklava in awhile_ It was delicious_ It was drizzled in a light syrup, and wasn't quite as overwhelmingly rich as baklava can be sometimes_ \n\nThis is definitely a place where you can expect to relax - it's a small operation_ But just savor it, you're in Morocco!",)("Halal Hookup?\n\nI came here on the recommendation of a friend who stated that what is the best middle eastern joint out of all the popular places in town_\n\nAs my friend and I entered the restaurant we were cheerfully greeted by the owner and was warned that they had run out of the chicken option for that week_ Immediately we were given bottles of water instead of tap water without asking_ I asked the owner why she had done this and she told me that they had run out of ice and would rather have me a drink bottled water_ It would have been nice if she had given us the option in the first place_\n\nI decided to get the lamb tagine (marinated lamb shank served over rice) which was a popular dish of the restaurant_ Did dish was simple, the meat was very easy to pull off the bone but was a bit on the dry side_ I couldn't understand the appeal of this restaurant, and would much rather get my halal hook up from other places in the valley especially in Tempe for less than 15 dollars_ \n\nThe owner disappeared for the remainder of our meal and when we ended our meal, the owner was nowhere to be found at the store front_ We ended up having to find her office and asking for the check_",)('We were passing through Phoenix on our way to California, and eventually to Seattle, and we found this family friendly restaurant just near our hotel_ We were craving for Moroccan couscous and lamb Tajine_ Boy was it delicious! We had the lamb Tajine, and my daughter had the chicken kebab_ For dessert we had the kunafah_ Everything was delicious and we though we were somewhere in  Marakesh or Rabat_ The owner went out of our way to accommodate us by making fresh kunafah even though it was sold out as we went for a late dinner_',)('Definitely a fan of Moroccan cuisine_ Delicious chicken couscous, lamb, and goat_',)("There ( almost ) is no need to hop the Marrakech Express since we have Alzohour Market right here in Phoenix_ Islamic clothing , groceries and other items are sold here but there also is a very modest small Moroccan Restaurant and Bakery here_ The food we tried was delicious_ Service was VERY pleasant but terribly slow_ I think it took them a half hour to bring our beverages_ Only one  other small table was in the restaurant and our meal was a two hour stay so that should be noted_ I also noticed that table of four people had each plate delivered to them one by one and NOT TOGETHER! I think it might be very hectic for them to serve more than two tables at a time_\n\nWe shared the B'Stilla_ It's a Moroccan Appetizer_ It's a very large House Made Phyllo Pastry stuffed with shredded chicken, almonds, and cinnamon_ It very delicious and certainly unique_ It really feeds four or more people but we wanted to try it_\n\nThen we shared another Moroccan dish the Fish Tangine_ It was Cod on a sizzling skillet in a Tomato based sauce with onions ,  bell peppers , preserved lemons and exotic spices_ It was very fragrant and spicy!
