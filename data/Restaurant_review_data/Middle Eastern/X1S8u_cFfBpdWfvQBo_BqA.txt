The server initially brought out freshly made pita (which is made in house and you can definitely tell!)__ it was so fluffy and warm, I'm still salivating over it_  We had a great experience and the atmosphere was really cool_  Very clean restaurant & bathrooms were clean too_  I look forward to coming back and trying more and more of the menu!",)('Amazing hummus with chicken shwarma, fatoush salad and grilled lamb_ Being from Detroit_Dearborn MI I have had alot of Lebanese food and this was so delicious that we wanted to go back the next day despite living 40 miles away_ This place is solid in all that they do that I am very impressed_ It is so nice to have a well prepared and served meal that does not leave you feeling all bloated and uncomfortable afterwards_',)("If my experience was solely about this meal, the rating would have been much lower_  However, I have eaten here before and the gyros, hummus and some other items are amazing_ I had a take out order and decided to try something new so I ordered the falafel (which I've had many times at other places and love)_  It looked really odd to me_  It looked super dry and crispy_  It was completely void of flavor except for a nutmeg type spice flavor_  Which was also different, I personally didn't care for it and didn't eat them_  It may have been overcooked??  And I asked for pita chips with the hummus and I got this little pieces that resembled broken chips in the bottom of the bag_  Wayyyy to small, no way to scoop up hummus with them without getting it all over yourself_  And finally____pretty basic to make sure you put napkins and silverware in a take out order_",)("My company actually got our event catered by Zeta's Grill and we were completely blown away! Everything was so fresh and tasted SO unbelievably good_ The chicken was probably my favorite just because it was cooked and seasoned to perfection_ I had the chicken shawarma and even though the ingredients are so simple, the taste is really intricate and unique_ Definitely a must try! \n\nI really have nothing but amazing things to say about the food_ Everything from the hummus to the falafels were divine! Will for sure be eating here again!",)("Went to Zeta's while visiting my daughter in Avondale_ I got the Kafta hummus combo and my daughter got the chicken kabob special_ We liked the hummus so much we ordered an extra side order and gobbled up every drop_ The service was prompt and friendly and brought us water multiple times_ I will definitely return on my next trip_ They also have some yummy imported candy and whatnots by the cash register, stop in and check it out_",)("The food is good but seems pricey for the amount of food you get_ I was disappointed with the pita that comes with a take-out meal_ They look like a thin store bought pita that you cut in 1_2 and stuff with lunch meat, but someone cut the top layer off, so all that's left is the really thin bottom layer_ I do like the saffron rice, grilled chicken kabob and the little pickles a lot_\n\nUpdate: I am amending my review and changing my rating to 4 stars after the owner reached out to me to understand what happened_ I had originally included a note that the greek salad is a joke because it doesn't have feta cheese on it_ I have since removed that from my review as we figured out that the salad that comes with the chicken kabob entr e is NOT a greek salad, and that's why it didn't have feta cheese on it (my misunderstanding)_ The owner also explained that the pita that comes with the take out meal is different from what is served when you dine in and that I can ask for a fresh thick pita with my take out order next time (which are made in-house and sound delicious)_  I really appreciate the owner reaching out to me to understand what happened and the desire to make a customer happy_ I am really impressed by that_ I will try the food again, but this time order the greek salad and ask for the fresh thick pita!",)('What a nice surprise! We came here on the hope that the food was similar to our fave restaurant in Portland_ Well it far surpassed that place_ And the service! Niko greeted us quickly and got us drinks_ I asked for a crisp white wine and he suggested their Lebanese chardonnay_ Delish_ My husband got a tasty Gin & tonic_   \nWe decided on a mixed platter with a kafta kebob and lamb & beef shwarma_  We decided on these to see how their meats and sides are prepared - well they were great!  The kafta kebab was so tender and tasty_  The hummus, baba and tabouleh were perfect_  The lamb & beef shwarma  were  tender and perfectly prepared_ \nNiko was so personable_ He gave us pointers on other places in the valley to get good food & escaoe the summer heat_  \nIn all, a marvelous experience_ We shall be back soon!!',)("I am happy to say we have returned to Zita's Grill several times to find a huge improvement from my earlier review_ Zeta's Combo Platter is a nice combination of fresh enjoyable bites of goodness_ Tabouleh is not my favorite salad (prefer Fattoush)  but it is better than I have had at other Mediterranean restaurants_ Very good food and service_",)('Their pita bread is awesome!

The chicken shawarma and rice were delicious_ My hubby and I hadn't been to the restaurant since it was opened_ The experience was much better then our first_ We will definitely be back to try some more options from the menu!",)('First time here, the salad was light and refreshing_ My date and I had the salmon kabob with spicy potatoes it was awesome!!!

This restaurant is a tremendous addition to the West Valley_ My wife and I shared a tabouli salad, the Kibbeh Nayyeh, and the mixed Lebanese pickles for appetizers_ The pickle dish was nowhere near as impressive as the picture on the website, but aside from this one small mistake, the rest of the meal has made us determined to share with everyone how great it is to find fresh Lebanese food in Avondale! The lemony tabouli dressing was delicious and so we'll be glad to pick this salad up in the future for a healthy lunch or light dinner_ The kibbeh was the highlight, nicely spiced and served with onions and pine nuts, and although it might sound strange to order raw lamb, it's the best we've had anywhere_ Try it! Because we ate three appetizers and all of the hot pita bread that came with oil and thyme before our meal, we kept the main course simple, each of us ordering a shawarma sandwich_ I had the beef, and I'll be sure to order it again the future because the tahini sauce was perfect_ My wife enjoyed the chicken_ For dessert, we shared some baklava_ We both hope that West Valley residents will support Zeta's!",)("First, let me comment on the atmosphere and condition of the space_ It was inviting, very clean, and the waitress was kind and attentive_ I believe the atmosphere sets the tone for the food you are about to enjoy_ However, I have to say the food was lackluster_ \n\nWe ordered lamb kabobs, chicken shawarma, and hummus chicken shawarma_ When you sit down the waitress brings a basket of fresh pita bread and oil with spices to dip_ I have no complaints about the pita bread_ It had that homemade taste and soul warming quality_ We were hopeful since the pita bread was quite enjoyable_ \n\nMy husband ordered the chicken shawarma and he has had a few in his lifetime, especially during his time in Eastern Europe_ He wasn't very impressed with Zeta's version, Maybe because he has had some excellent shawarma? Any who, I ordered the hummus chicken shawarma and it was good_ The hummus was creamy and the chicken was seasoned well_ My main complaint, and my family agreed,  was with the lamb kabobs_ The lamb was hard to chew, no flavor whatsoever, and the vegetables were on the raw side versus charred from ample time on grill_ \n\nOverall, I find this place to be just average_ I will be going back to taste other dishes in hopes of giving a more generous review if deserved_ Maybe there is a dish they make that will blow my mind and I just missed it this visit_ Staying hopeful and planning a future trip to test that theory_",)("Great food and friendly atmosphere_ We came for a dinner and enjoyed every bite of it_ Wonderful recommendation on Daily Special made my day! Thank you_ I will recommend to try their babaganoush (I think I spelled it right)_ The best I've ever tried_",)("The owner reached out to me after my negative review and offered an apology and a full refund_  I appreciate the gesture and will give Zeta's a second chance_  I'll update my review at that time_",)("The location is in a spot where you can easily pass by, but in a nice complex next to EOS fitness_ The restaurant is very nice, spacious, and decorated very well_ I would have loved to sit outside if the weather was better_ The food was awesome!

I thought I would be adventurous and try some new food_ I am of course a big fan of gyros and have tried quite a few places in the area_ I tried the plate with hummus, falafel, green salad (already forgot name of) and lamb skewer_ I loved the hummus right off but I was familiar with that, and that's kind of where the love ended_ The green salad was very strong flavored, I tried to eat it but just could not, did not like the falafel either, I wanted to because I heard they were good_ I did like the flavor of the lamb skewer but way over cooked! The pita was good, but did not stay soft but still liked it with the hummus! My hubby had the gyro with fries, he liked it and the fries were very good! I guess I will stick to what I know and if we return will definitely get the gyro! So in short go try it yourself as all taste are different, it's a very nice restaurant we were the only couple in there, for lunch as we were leaving one more couple arrived_ The young lady who waited on us was very attentive and helpful_",)("Zeta's grill is very authentic middle eastern food_ The have a very extensive menu with meals for everyone_ I have had a great deal of middle eastern food in my life and Zeta's is definitely among the best!
