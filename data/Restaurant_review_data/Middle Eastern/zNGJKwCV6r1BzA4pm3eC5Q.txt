("Fresh ingredients, friendly service, a family-run, breath of fresh air to our neighborhood in Glendale! The two of us ate (take out) plenty for just over _20 plus tip_ All of the sauces and things I didn't know what they were, rather than describe them to me, they had me try! Just like I was in someone's grandmother's kitchen; a good feeling_ The kitchen is right behind the counter so you see your food being prepared, cooked and served_ All the better to ask questions while they do it_\n\nOn the down side they were out of falafel and a few other dishes when I came in around 7pm on a Saturday evening_ The place was deserted, I even asked if they were open_ \n\nAll in all a charming place and nice find of a new restaurant and gracious hosts_ We will definitely come again!",)("Being a vegetarian, I am always on the lookout for a good place and Abdeen has some of the freshest, best falafels near my school_ They are divine_ Combine that with super friendly service and affordable, graduate school friendly rates, you know that you've got yourself a deal_ \n\nThe falafel with potatoes sandwich is my fav!!",)
