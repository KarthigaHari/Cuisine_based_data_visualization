After perusing the short menu I opted for the Crab Fried Rice and Egg Rolls_ I wasn't mad either! The Crab Fried Rice was delicious; though for _17 a plate I would expect a tad bit more for my palate, I'm not complaining_ I washed both down with, not one but, 2 Moscow Mules (one with plain Vodka and the other with Cranberry)_ Absolutely delicious! I typically stay with my top shelf Cadillac Margarita but I'm glad I tried something new_ Deep Eddy Vodka is a must try!\n\nNow my second trip___ehhh_ While my two Moscow Mules and the live music were on point, I tried something new; Papaya Salad_ Now___the first item of the description reads: Grilled Prawns_ Oh boy! It's on and poppin'! Added an order of Egg Rolls and I was good to go_ I guzzled down my first Mule and my food arrived_ Right on time_ Salad piled high and Egg Rolls delicately placed on the plate_ I dipped and chewed, dipped and chewed_ Mmm! \n\nAs I gently cut up my salad I noticed two shrimp sitting cute on the corner of the squared plate_ Great! I thought, garnish_ The rest must be under the julienned papaya and carrots_ I was a little miffed to find that there were NO more shrimp (they weren't big enough to be labeled as prawns in my book)_ I politely called a waitress over and asked if the salad came with only two shrimp_ And she pleasantly said, _Yes__ WHAT?! I would've been embarrassed to admit that_ There should've at least been 4-5_ My goodness! I cut each one into fourths to spread out the goodness I WAS expecting and kept it moving_ \n\nNonetheless, the service is great! I just wish the portions were plentiful_",)('Love this restaurant!

This is LONG overdue because we have been to Chao at least 20 times since it's opened_  While I've tried many things, the Chicken Prik King is my favorite!

Apparently not___ not only did the drinks not arrive for about another ten minutes, but we didn't get the apps for another :25_ When he dropped the drinks off, we knew we'd better get him to fire our entrees (even before we received our apps)_ Judging by the tables around us that (too) were getting annoyed, we were not alone in our plight_  Tables went unbussed, drinks went unfilled and people were generally getting pretty surly_  We finally received our entrees about 1:45 minutes into our experience, which leads me to___\n\nThe GOOD: Chao's food is really delicious_ Aside from our appetizers being tepid when they arrived (I  put that on the wait staff), our food was delicious_  We had an order of Penang shrimp and two others I don't recall by name, but all were tasty and well presented_ \n\nThe REMEDY:  When finally checked on by our server,  we mentioned the length of time we had languished at out table_  The remedy was that our appetizers were comped_  This was fine and surely appreciated, but it would have made our experience less anxiety-ridden had we been _touched_ by the management or told earlier in the meal that something was being done to accommodate us   (we certainly were not looking for compensation)_  I guess that is just part of the growing pains of opening a new shop_\n\nWell, I've certainly prattled on long enough, but suffice to say, we'll probably wait a few weeks_months before giving this spot another chance_ I hope they are able to fix the kinks, because the food is (almost) worth the wait_",)("Had the Andaman Duck and would get it again_\n Also tasted the Pad Thai that's also very tasty",)('Best Thai food in the Valley!
