You need to check out this restaurant if you are close by:)',)('Have gone 3 times, so far,  and has been phenomenal every time_  The pad see ew has a rich and savory flavor without coming off as overly heavy_  The thai basil signature dish was also amazingly flavorful and packed full of veggies_ The last dish I had was the chili garlic vegetables,  I have to admit it was also a good dish,  the vegetables were fresh with a pleasant crunch and mixed well with the sauce__ in every dish I had the tofu (crispy) and firmly think they make the best tofu in town_  Definitely worth checking out this new place!',)("Love it here! Many combinations and plates for even difficult eaters like me! you just pick your protein for the dish- me tofu and my boyfriend shrimp and pork_ Definitely will be returning to try out other menu items and next time won't make the mistake of setting my mouth on fired by getting my fried rice _Thai spicy_ very good, but too hot for me___ I'll be sticking to mild",)("Great and authentic Thai food! Love the curry noodles, pad see ew, and fries rice_ Sticky rice was on point too! If you don't like it from uber eat you should try it in store_",)("Really Good Thai the service was amazing and me and my family of 3 split phad Thai and a curry was perfect amount and it was a great price I wish they have this stuff where I live_ I recommend this to most family's and the waiter we talked with a lot next time I come to Tempe I will defentliy come to ThaiTini_ It was an amazing place You should go",)('I love this place!

The parking is in the back (the previous business name at this location is posted which makes for some confusion and fear of being towed)_  Our group ordered a large variety of items and the were all absolutely delicious_  Even the little kids in the group enjoyed their noodles which is a rarity_ The service was prompt and helpful_ We're definitely coming back here next time we're in Tempe!",)('My friend recommended this place to me, so I decided to give it a try_ I ordered a crab fried rice and it was PRETTY GOOD_ But man, it only had a few pieces of crab meet on top of a whole bowl of fried rice, and it was _17_ The price is unreasonable to me_',)("I always thought spicy noodles_drunken noodles were the same thing_ Apparently not because they have one of each_ The food was mostly peppery_ But the best part_ The menu says lunch comes with a soup OR salad_ Nope only salad_ And it was three pieces of iceberg lettuce and a drizzle some sweet sauce_ I've tried many Thai places and this is one I will not return to____ you have got to see the picture of my salad_ #embarrassing to serve, if I was the waitress I could not walk that over to someone's table_ No I did not touch this salad before the picture was taken!",)('Great food, great service, comfortable setting with generous, tasty and delicious Thai treats_ Very reasonable prices for such a pleasant dining experience!',)('Not bad, not great_  Larb tasted like flavors did not have time to set in_  Thai basil stir fry a little better_  Very hard to find great Thai in Phoenix_',)("We ordered food to pick up and it was ready on time and very hot! The drunken noodles were delicious the chicken is high quality and there were plenty of veggies and flavor_ we ordered medium spicy but it was a little mild for my taste but every place is different_ We also ordered pad thai which had no spice at all when we ordered medium so that was a little disappointing_ It was decent not the best i've ever had but satisfying if you're in the mood for pad thai_ We didn't go inside but the place looked new and nice from the outside_ The two dishes were _25 combined_ If you're really hungry the portion sizes are not super huge but the price isn't terrible for good thai food_ Would order from them again and either ask for spicier food or make sure to order a side of chili paste to add to the food!",)('Solid Thai place_ Surprised by food -- would def recommend_ Really like the drunken noodles; garlic vegetables with chicken was also really good_ Service needs improvement _- only had one server on a busy Friday night_',)('This place is awesome!

Not only do they have lunch specials from 11-3, but they also give out a 15% discount for all students! Out of all the Thai restaurants in Tempe that I had, this is BY FAR my favorite!",)('The food was absolutely amazing, but I thought it was pretty pricey_ I got the pineapple fried rice which was unexpectedly wonderful, but came with a price tag of about _14_ I understand entrees being _11-12ish, but options for rice should be lower or have different sizes :) Food really was amazing though, friend I went with also really loved his Pad Thai',)('11_10am already_ But they said _we are not open yet_ and _nobody come to work yet_  Hello!!!! \n\nPlease change Time to open!!
