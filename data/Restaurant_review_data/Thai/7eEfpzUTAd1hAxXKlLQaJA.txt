("As cultured as my palate is, I have never enjoyed Thai food_  It has always been my least favorite type of food___until now_  I was reluctant to go to Tipp's because I have always had a bad experience with Thai food, but my friend wanted to go for her birthday, so who was I to refuse?  I'm so glad I didn't_  \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I noticed the spaciousness and cleanliness of the area_  There's a cute little bar you can sit at if you want, too_  We were greeted by a friendly man who promptly seated us and was then quickly waited on for our drink orders_  My friend LOVED the Thai iced tea she ordered_  I forget the name of the entree I ordered, but it was kind of like pad Thai but with squid_  The squid came out perfect and complemented the noodles just right_  One of my other friends ordered the Hawaiian rice plate, and it was really good as well_  The portions are kinda big, the prices are kinda perfect, and the service is kinda awesome, so I highly recommend_  If you think you hate Thai, think again_  Go to Tipp's_\n\nNote: There appears to be a party area, so if you're looking to host a bigger group, I believe this place can accommodate_",)("My wife and I really love Thai foods and we've been a regular at Tipp's 88 for a while now_  Our favorite dishes are Eggplant Pad Prik and Pla Rad Prik_  These 2 dishes really complement each other well_  You can also substitute Pla Rad Prik with Pepper Mushroom Fish (I don't remember the exact name)_  \n\nThe service is good and they are very friendly to everyone_  For me, Tipp's 88 is definitely one of the best Thai restaurant in Tempe_",)('Really good_  I learned was real spicey is like_  When I go back, I am going to get it mild_  My face turned red_',)("Why did this place close?? I've been thinking (literally dreaming) about the drunken spicy noodles for the past 5 years since they peaced out_ So sad! Where can I get this kind of food now??? Please come back!",)("If a delicious Thai joint collided with a staid log-cabin interior you would find Tipps 88 Thai at your service_\n\nIt's relatively new (almost 1 year) and in a curious setting (a Kill Bill style sushi place?), but no less satisfying_  I was here for lunch recently and had decent food, ok service and an overall good experience here_ \n\nThe well-designed menu is very helpful for novices, giving ample descriptions and some photos_  The lunch special shrimp pad thai (which came with a peanut dressing side salad) did not disappoint_  The portions were generous for _7, there was just enough shrimp, and even better -- the food tasted shrimpy and almost briny, compared to other restaurants that cook the pad thai and then toss in (name your meat here) at the end_  My dining partner Gabi, had an (add your colorful adjective here) amazing eggplant tofu curry_\n\nThe stream of lunchtime diners was steady but cleared by 1 p_m_  I found the food and service to be much more pleasing than Thai Basil and is a reliable choice if you're wanting Thai in Tempe_",)("I'm not one to give something five stars if it's not exactly five stars_ I had the Kang Jued Pak bowl, and the Kao Pad with chicken I asked for mild hottness which is really weak_ I ordered take out they told me it would take 10 minutes and it did_ The Jued Pak bowl was basicaly an Asian chicken soup with some weird Asian vegetables in it_ It tasted good nothing special it costed 5 bucks and I got a decent amount_ As for the Kao Pad with chicken it was basically fried rice with chicken in it_ A guy on here said if you order spicy it comes very hot so I ordered mild_ And it wasn't spicy at all but almost sweet_ Overall the food was average and a couple dollars more than the panda express_ I would rather eat at the panda for that price_ The panda has allot more flavor_ I give tipps 88 an A for healthiness_ The outside looks super fancy but the inside was hole in the wall_ I've eaten better_",)("Tipps 88 is quite new (Today is 9_10_07) and in the location previously occupied by Ichiban Japanese restaurant_  I stopped by for lunch and the place was very quiet_  I only saw two other tables the whole time I was there_    The environment was clean and bright and the staff was rather chipper_  The menu was quite extensive and included a lot of lunch options_  I decided on my first visit to choose a couple of tried and tested Thai dishes_  I will probably go back and explore the menu in the future_\n\nI ordered the Tom Kha Gai (chicken) soup and it was incredible_  Very strong coconut flavor whereas I often find it watered down and muted in flavor at other restaurants_  I did order the soup 'hot' on the spice spectrum but it seemed quite mild to me_\n\nThe entree I ordered was the panang pork_  I was offered on three options for the spiciness of the dish: mild, medium, or Thai hot_  Having experienced the incredibly intense heat of 5-star, thai hot dishes I went with the medium_   The panang seemed to have no spice to it at all, however its flavor was very good_  The pork was excellent!  Very thin and cooked perfectly_  Aside from the dish being a little too thin in texture and not as spicy as I had hoped, it was very good and I would enjoy it again_",)("Great Thai food_  I have eaten here about a billion times and have tried almost everything on the lunch menu_  We're such regulars here that the waitress didn't even ask what we wanted to drink last time, she just brought it out_  \n\nThe only thing I don't like about the place is that the spice tends to wreck my digestive tract, but I can't blame them for that___ After all, spicy food is supposed to do that_  Just don't go the day before you have a round of golf planned_\n\nDefinitely a step above the overcrowded Thai Basil, and the over slow Thai Elephant_",)("This place took us a while to hear about, and then even a little more time to actually get out to,  but totally worth it_  Finding a Thai place with a legit vegetarian menu full of deliciousness is pretty difficult_ This one has one, and more!\n\nSo much goodness on the menu, and they even made me something that wasn't on the menu, going above and beyond_ Plus their vegetarian Tom Yum and Tom Kah soups are delicious, as is their tofu satay starter_\n\nService is OK, but that's there they lose a star_  Once it took ups almost 40 minutes to get our soup, and our water glasses often stay empty way too long_ Plus, at least in the winter, it's always freezing in here_\n\nHowever, the food and fairly affordable prices plus excellent vegetarian Thai selection make it well worth braving the mediocre service and chilly temps_",)
