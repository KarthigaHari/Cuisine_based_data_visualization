It really takes away from the experience_',)('Incredible Service and Marvelously Flavorful Food! Im Their BIGGEST FAN! I Highly Recommend All of you Gibe it a Taste!',)('Great Thai food, with nice outdoor seating_ Friendly service, good quality, no complaints_',)("My husband and I have ordered take out from Thai Patio two Sundays in a row_ Normally, we have our favorite Thai place that we eat at which is not too far from our house but since that place is closed on Sundays and I was in the mood for a quick Thai noodles dish, I looked for an alternative on Yelp and found Thai Patio & I'm glad I did! \nEven though some reviews talked about the food being bland, most agreed that the noodle dishes were great_ My husband and I are big fans of Pad See Eew beef and I love Pad Thai so yesterday we ordered just that for take out (Pad Thai chicken though) and my husband picked them up_ \nThe convenience in take out is great but I normally don't prefer it bcz I worry about the food arriving cold; not in this case though! Because the food is cooked fresh and the restaurant is very close to where we live, the food arrived super hot, I still had to be careful not to burn my mouth when I ate! Nice! \nWe dug in and the pad see eew in particular was great (I ordered one last week too and it was really good)_ I had the pad Thai a little later and while it tasted very good, it was a little dry, probably my fault though coz I waited for a while before I ate it and I have noticed more than once that those rice noodles usually suck up the sauce very quickly_ Nevertheless, both dishes were really good and fresh_ We asked for the chili sauce to be on the side so we can control the level of heat, and their chili sauce was really good too! When we added it to the food it gave it a really great kick_ \nI am so glad we found this place_ Even though we have our favorite Thai restaurant, I think when it comes to those particular dishes, I have actually enjoyed them more here! Not to mention the fact that they open everyday particularly on Sundays & they are closer to our home_ \nI will try different dishes hopefully in the next times but for now, I think this is my fav Thai place for our favorite noodle dishes! We'll be back!",)("All I have to say is that this thai place has no lime or fish sauce in their food_  \nI even requested it and they said they didn't have any_ \nthat's two basic ingredients in all thai dishes_  I was not so happy with the food;(",)("After going thru a bit of a trial and error period with local Thai restaurants, I think I've settled in on my go to place___ Thai Patio_ \n\nSince I've only ever gotten take-out, I don't have any first hand experience with the service in the restaurant, but at the counter placing the order and picking up they have been friendly and very accommodating_ So, my 4 Stars is only related to the take out service and limited number of things I've had on the menu, but so far so good_  We've had the Thai Patio Spicy Mint w_Chicken, Spicy Basil w_ Pork and Chowmein noodles and all have been solid_  The Mango Sticky Rice is like crack and my daughter is totally hooked on the Thai Iced Tea_ \n\nI've ordered using the Yelp app and it was seamless_ But when either using the app or ordering in person at the counter, the wait has been a little on the long side_ With that being said, they have always been apologetic and tried to be accommodating with a drink and refill while we waited_  Like I said, considering the Land of Misfit Toys I've been thru trying to find a decent Thai restaurant, I can manage the wait time_",)("Cute, clean, and cozy Thai restaurant in east Mesa_ Service is gracious, speedy, and friendly_ Lunch prices can't be beat_ I got a choice of soup or salad with my entree as well as a fried spring roll with a drink for _11_ The panang curry with beef is very tasty_ Their Thai iced tea is delish, too_",)("What Rebekah said! So happy to FINALLY have great Thai in our 'hood_ And it's as good as any Thai I've ever had!! I've had the spicy basil (really delicious sauce and nice veggies), drunken noodles (my fave noodle dish and this is as tasty as I've had) and the bbq pork lunch special which was sweet grilled goodness_\n\nI will be going multiple times per week!",)("Delicious Pad Thai! Green Curry was out of this world good_  I've never had eggplant that was so tender and delicious_  I will definitely go back_",)('Lunch orders are 8_00 not 7_00_ Food is good___ really good_ I will definitely be back_',)("We've been going here since they opened_ The owners are a nice young couple and they work very hard_ Everything is always fresh and tasty_ I especially love the Thai Patio Salad, the Pad Thai, the Red Curry and the Red Garlic River_ Great food!",)
