Yes_  Would I order the same thing, sure___ but I would dial down the heat just a notch_ Would I get the Thai Tea? You bet! I recommend it as well_\n\nHappy Yelping!',)("Service was a little slow but that doesn't hurt the scoring as much, the lady was very sweet and it was hectic with just the two servers_ The food is a little pricey and the meat in my Pingang curry was a little tough_ The price paid vs the quality had me score this a little lower_ And man, the rating of spicy is high! I can usually handle a 4 like a champ, the 4 here almost made me cry_ Tasty but not my top fav_",)("I actually like this place and would like to give it a higher rating, but I felt like there should be a more inexpensive lunch special_  There is harsh competition out there for lunch_  My pad thai was pretty good, but I didn't really feel like there was any spice to it at all_  I asked for medium_ I guess next time I will ask for hot_  The prawns were a decent size_  I do plan on trying them again, for dinner maybe_",)("Just tried this place tonight with my best friend and it was bomb_ The Thai tea was so so yummy_ They were friendly_ My best friend got red curry and I got yellow curry_ Their levels go from 1-6, 6 being the hottest_ I got level 3 on the yellow curry and he got 2 on the red curry_ His was spicier but I think the red curry is naturally spicier than yellow curry is_ Which I never realized before_ Both very good but I'm more of a yellow curry kind of girl_ That's typically what I get when I get Thai food_ I'm typically very picky about my Thai restaurants_ I have my favorite but this place is pretty good too! I was very satisfied_ A must try!",)('Excellent food and many vegetarian options! The Panang and the Drunken noodles as well as the summer rolls are excellent!',)
