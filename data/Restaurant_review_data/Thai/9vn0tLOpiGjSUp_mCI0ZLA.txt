Green curry and Pad thai with shrimp was fantastic_ Also, the atmosphere inside was fabulous especially the huge chandelier in the middle of the restaurant plus the color and tone make me feel like i was in the high end restaurant_ Finally found new spot to hangout with friends with good service at reasonable price_ Go check this place out!!!!',)('The service was ok I was there during lunch today and they forgot to serve me the soup that came with my lunch order_ The portion was ok and flavors were there so so_ Definitely will not return_',)('I ordered takeout from Jasmine this week and had a great experience - quick service, friendly staff and delicious food_  We enjoyed the steamed dumplings (wish we had ordered more), the panang curry with pork and the pad see ew with pork_  This will definitely become a habit to pick-up on my way home from yoga!',)
