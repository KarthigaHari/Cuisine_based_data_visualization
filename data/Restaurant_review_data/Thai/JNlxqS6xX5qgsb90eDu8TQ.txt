("I'm a huge lover of Asian food and haven't had the best of luck in finding a good place_ I've been here twice and the food is just absolutely delicious! It's a very tidy and clean place, which is  much appreciated_ The interior is modern and welcoming and to top it off the customer service is astounding_ The food is great, affordable, and you have a bunch of yummy left overs as well_ This place deserves way much more traffic than it has_ I strongly urge anyone who loves Asian food to give them a try, they don't disappoint_",)("Excellent food and super clean! Oh_ And great service__ Good sized portions I can complain that's for sure!",)('Best orange chicken I have ever try! Delicious mango lemonade_ Excellent service, i will recommend_',)("Good service had the chicken pad thai_  Wasn't that spicy could have turned the heat up a bit and I wouldn't have cared but very fresh and good portion size_",)("Impressed with everything pho was delicious staff was very awesome * please tip them they work very hard , the mango lemonade is the best thing I've ever had",)('Great new place!!! I will definitely be back!!! Very good Asian mix! Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese was awesome concept!',)("This is the best food I've had out in a long time_ Everything was made fresh and the portions on the lunch menu are perfect_ If you haven't been here yet, it's worth the trip_ The Mongolian beef was bomb and the orange chicken was awesome too_ But the Singapore noodles were the best I've ever had_",)('Amazing Pho!!! They were even able to accommodate my special request of vegetable broth for the tofu vegetable pho_ The tofu was perfect and the pho was robust, and packed with amazing herbs, seasoning, and spices_ Thank you so much for the great experience and can not wait to come back_ :)',)
