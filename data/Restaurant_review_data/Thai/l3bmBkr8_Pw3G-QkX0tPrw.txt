Definitely visiting this place back :)',)('Price is amazing and food is out of this world good I would eat here every day if I could so yummy and nice staff',)("What is the deal with the small servings of food sitting on bar stolls outside the doors of the restaurant?\n\nThe smell inside was a bit mildewy_\n\nWas not offered any drink other than water so that is what my friend and I stuck to_\n\nShe ordered the spicy pork fried rice off the lunch menu and was highly impressed_  I asked for a bowl of Tom Kha soup even though it wasn't on the lunch menu with tofu and vegetables_  It was the smallest bowl of soup I have ever received in a thai restaurant_  For about the price I pay anywhere else it was 1_3 the size_  It was tasty though_  I was so starving after finishing it that I had to order another item from the lunch menu to eat_  I ordered the eggplant with rice and salad_  The salad was simple but with a very delightful dressing_  The eggplant was also very tasty_  I took a very small portion home for b_fast the next day_  Even the spring roll that comes with the lunch was the tiniest one I have ever seen_\n\nSo long story short_  Tasty food at super tiny serving sizes_  I don't think I wll go back_",)('This plays says what it does, and does what it says_  The Thai here is tasty_ \n\nYou have to have good Thai in this part of town as there are 3 other options within a mile of here_ \n\nTheir lunch menu has all of the favorites, plus a few Chinese dishes like orange chicken_ For most dishes tofu is an option which I really appreciate_ For lunch dishes are 6_95 (for tofu, chicken or beef) and a buck or two more for seafood options_\n\nThe meal includes Soup, or salad_ I had the salad and the simple oil and vinegar dressing was great_ A small veggie spring roll and rice if it is not a noodle dish_ The rice comes pressed in a nice flower pattern_\n\nI opted for the spicy noodles to tofu, Thai Hot_  I was glad that Thai hot here really means hot not just semi spicy, the dish was good, but not the best ever it seemed a bit dry and could have used a bit more sauce_\n\nOverall this is a solid pick for the area',)('Reasonable price with tasty food_ The portion is big, I even bring my left over home_ I like their tom kha, they were so generous to give us a lot of meat',)('If you are tired of all the tasteless American foods, just come here to treat yourself something that you will not forget_ The Tom Yum is beyond delicious_ sharply sour and brilliantly spiced_ Anything with duck is amazing as well_ It is in a different league compared to Thai Basil_',)("Stopped in for a quick lunch during the week based on the good reviews of the place_  Service was quick and friendly_ Ordered a lunch combo (spicy noodle?) with tofu_  The soup that came with it was a little sad___ it was about 2 spoonfuls, no kidding_  \n\nRest of the food came quickly and looked much more promising than the soup, however I took a bite of the spring roll and immediately realized that this would NOT be my #1 thai place, nor #52 on the list_\n\nThe spring roll was cold (yes, cold, not even lukewarm) and so was some of the tofu throughout the dish_  The dish itself had good flavor, but the random cold pieces of tofu were a turn off to say the least_  Disappointing meal & I won't be returning_",)("Perfect lunch portions and prices_ If you like it hot, go for their Thai Hot, as their regular hot isn't as hot as they advertise_ \n\nI totally love this place_ Don't get turned off if you go in and there aren't any other diners_ Every time I sit here to eat in the evening there are 10 people coming for Take-Out_",)("My favorite Thai in Tempe_  The green curry was a little salty last time I had it, but I had gotten medium spice, so the next time I got yellow curry, Thai hot, and it was wayyyyyyyyy better_  The lunch portions are a little small, but if you eat in you also get a salad_  Its still enough for me, but I eat the ENTIRE thing (probably seems like its small because I don't want to stop eating it! YUM!) I'm satisfied when I'm done eating, but forget leftovers (which is ok with me; I'm not a fan of the HUGE portions I've gotten over the years_)\n\nTo Jasmin (other reviewer): The smell in the restaurant is actually eggs, not mildew (making fried rice, perhaps?) I don't really like eggs, or the smell, but its not mildew_ The small plates of food you refer to are traditional offerings to Buddha_  The restaurant is very traditional in their decor, which includes mirrors (reflecting on yourself inside), flowers, fruit and water offerings_  I've never been to a Thai restaurant that tries to _up sell_ you on a drink_  If you want something other than water, order it (I suggest Thai tea___its like drinking dessert while you eat!)\n\nGreat place to get Thai___it is, indeed, Tasty!",)
