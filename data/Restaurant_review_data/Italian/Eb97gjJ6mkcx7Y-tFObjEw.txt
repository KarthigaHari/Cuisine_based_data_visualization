The restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere as well, with a beautiful mural painted by a local artist on their east wall_ The staff is very friendly too!",)("Great lunch addition to Scottsdale and Shea!    With so many mediocre lunch restaurant chains in middle Scottsdale, it is such a relief to be able to grab lunch from a spot that focuses on producing great sandwiches using fresh ingredients_  Leoni's is run by local chefs that are well versed in quality, authentic Italian sandwiches_  The staff are friendly, the service is quick and the sandwiches are superb_ Great bread and fresh ingredients = many return visits_",)('We were driving through the area and stumbled upon this hidden gem_ Dwight was very personable and extremely hospitable_ I ordered the mozzarella and tomato, it was delicious! The focaccia bread is made in house and it was amazing!

This is it!\n\nAlways on the lookout for a new lunch spot, and discovered Leoni's Focaccia on the Yelp _Hot and New_ list (thanks for that!)\n\nI went with the Mortadella, Gorgonzola and sun-dried tomatoes sandwich_\nThe focaccia was soft with a nice crust_  The fillings were really great, and all worked together really well_\n\nAs we were finishing up, Danielle, the owner, came out to check on us to make sure our sandwiches were up to snuff_  (They were!)\nShe is also the proprietor of The Breadfruit downtown_  She told us they've only been open about a month_  Very nice lady_\n\nLeoni's is located in what I've been told was Scottsdale's first shopping center - a cool little area full of eclectic shops (and is also home to one of my favorite pizza places)_\n\nGive Leoni's a try for lunch!!!",)('I literally think Danielle and her staff make the best sandwich (and traditional Italian baked goods) in Arizona_ I stumbled here today from down the street and was so happy when I left_\n\nTheir interior is modern, very Milan feeling_ But the smell of this place is incredible_ \n\nI got the mortadella sandwich, the #1_ It has so much flavor in every square inch!

Best sandwiches- terrific lunch spot_ Nice to have a local, quality place with good fresh food and friendly service_',)("'Quality not quantity' is the operative phrase_  If you are lunch-lusting for a giant hoagie that no normal person would consume in a single sitting, an oversized bag of chips which the government says contains eight servings of chips and 4 days worth of sodium, and a refillable Super Big Gulp then this is NOT your type of Italian sandwich place_\n\nThink gourmet meats and cheeses_  Tiny italian sodas_  Fresh focaccia_  Biscotti and fancy Italian cookies_  This is not your father's sub shop_\n\nThe focaccia is great_  The sandwiches are great_  The help is super-great_  My one (tiny) complaint is they didn't put any napkins in my bag - but I expect that was just a (forgivable) oversight_  \n\nIf you want to save dough (sandwich pun) go to Subway - but if you have achieved enough in your life such that spending an extra _4 for a memorable, higher-quality lunch experience won't keep you from paying last month's overdue rent - go for it_  You will leave with a smile_",)
