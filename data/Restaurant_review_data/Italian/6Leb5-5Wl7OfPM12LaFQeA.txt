("Love this place_  Restaurant manager was incredibly nice and accommodating_  \n\nMy cherry mimosa was really good and so was my lobster and prosciutto benedict!  \n\nMy friend got the board and it was the third time she's gotten it (so assuming that's a good sign!)_ \n\nIt was a little quiet when we arrived on a Sunday so I really hope this place survives_   It is next to Central Kitchen (replaced OKRA)_",)('Let me tell you this is a must restaurant in the valley awesome food pizza unreal wife had the shrimp scampi she loved it service off the charts you will not be disappointed',)("We had a perfect evening at Pubblico Italian Eatery!  The service and food were amazing! We shared the smoked salmon and pesto bruschetta and the caprese salad, and I had the Seafood Fettucine while my husband had the spinach ravioli_ We also shared the creme br l e_  It was all delicious!!  We will definitely be making this a new regular dining spot_  It's our new favorite Italian restaurant_",)('Delicious! Came here for a rare date night and it was special without being over the top_ We had the shrimp scampi as an appetizer (I had an Italian margarita too___yum!!)_ Definitely recommend_ The restaurant is airy yet cozy at the same time_ Exceptional service_',)("This place is the best find ever_ From The bartenders and the servers to the ambiance and decor_ It is a win from the moment you walk through the doors_ I was there for a preview of their brunch menu and don't take my word for it, go and try it firsthand, it is absolutely delicious_ We had a charcuterie board and the prosciutto and lobster eggs Benedict, both were beautiful presentations and ever better tasting_ We were definitely members of the clean plate club_ The drinks were also great! My favorite was the publicco fizz with gin in place of the vodka, it is dangerously delicious_ The best part are the prices, for what we got I would expect to be paying a pretty penny, but everything was beyond reasonable for the quality and quantity_ I mean _3 mimosas! I'll definitely be going back and wouldn't be surprised if it becomes my new go to brunch spot!",)('Our meal was fantastic! The Rigatoni was 5 star and the service was great_ The interior was clean but very very noisy_',)("This place is EVIL!  \n\nYou definitely need to stay away from Mozzarella Carrozza! PURE EVIL YUMMY YUMMY GOODNESS!  We devoured it and had to order a second one___wait___I mean the dog ate it___yeah that's it_\n\nButternut Squash Gnocchi was pan-fried as well___SOOOOO good!  My wife had a hard time sharing it with me!\n\nThe Rigatoni was absolutely amazing!  It has a nice smoke flavor from the brick oven!  Nice amount of meat in the sauce and it worked well with the second piece of Mozzarella Carrozza!\n\nWe will definitely be back and soon!",)('This place just opened today and WOW! The service is great_ Bartenders are beautiful_ Food out of this world_ Pubblico is a must try_',)("P_I_E_ is everything we thought it would be_ The reviews of the food are spot on_ First, our waiter was Manny and he was GREAT!  He knew the menu like the backside of his hand and his recommendations were on par!!! We had a couple of appetizers, shrimp scampi and calamari, and both were fantastic! The marinara for the calamari was just like grandma's sauce! \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Cioppino and Beef Risotto_ Unfortunately, they were out of Lobster_ However, the owner (Danny) quickly came over and apologized_ He not only offered a solution but also poured us a tasty 5 oz of whiskey_  They also added additional clams and scallops to the dish! The risotto is made to order and done to perfection!!!! The home made pasta didn't disappoint and the sauce for the Cioppino was so delicious!   The owner was extremely attentive and our waiter was great!   \n\nWe will definitely make this place a regular stop on our Friday or Saturday night dinners!!!",)("Wow this place just opened yesterday and I see us becoming regulars_ The decor is warm and friendly with a modern twist, and we looked out onto the patio which we hope to sit soon_  Service was exceptional, as was my wine and my husband's old fashioned_  But dinner was amazing, from the bruschetta to the really lovely caesar salad, and our entrees were amazing_  You must have the seafood fettuccine_ I don't want to spoil it for you but you'll be ecstatic that you did_ We ended our meal with tiramisu, which was yummy_ With all of the restaurants on 7th Street that have opened in our North Central Phoenix neighborhood we still hadn't found our _Cheers_ until now_  What a great addition!",)("Definitely a spot to go to if you're looking for some belly warming Italian food_ The restaurant is in the space that Okra was in, and has a similar layout_ The decor is pretty simple but nice_ It looks like they have added an outdoor bar area that I don't remember from before_ Looks like a fun hangout spot_\n\nWe both had a glass of wine_ The list is brief but appropriate for the size of the restaurant, and we enjoyed both glasses_ I had the rigatoni and the SO had a pizza_ Both were delicious_ The rigatoni was a baked cheesy pile of yum, which was just what I was looking for at the time_ To me it was a generous portion, took some leftovers home_\n\nOur server was lovely_ Pleasant, attentive and helpful_ Overall, would definitely go back!",)("So happy with this place! Walked up there on Friday evening without a reservation but we were able to sit at the bar_ Both of the servers were fantastic! Very attentive even though every seat and table in the place was filled_ \n\nMy cocktail was excellent and reasonably priced_ The presentation of a non-alcoholic drink was very nice_ \n\nThe food___ GREAT!! My pet-peeve with Italian is that marinara sauce shouldn't taste like, and be full of sugar!! Pubblico's wasn't! It tasted like tomatos and was fresh with the right combination of spices_ It was fabulous_ \n\nAlso, I don't remember seeing any T_V_s behind the bar_ I could be wrong, but after we got home, I realized that I hadn't seen any_ Maybe someone can verify that_ If there are no T_V_s, I will love this place even MORE!\n\nTry it out_ You won't be disappointed_ Also, you'll be helping keep this great place in my neighborhood for me! :-) Thank you_",)('Great food well done but short in overall management as are allowing just about every thing being marinated in garlic marinade even their fish_ This is a lazy chefs way and a insult to the many garlic intolerant and allergic folks_ Place has too many hard surfaces and so very loud',)("Best Gcnocchi I've had in Phoenix_ The atmosphere is casual with amazing food_ House drinks are all spectacular and the wait staff are friendly and awesome_ We ordered the pesto penne, pepperoni pizza and GNOCCHI which were all amazing, fresh, and home made_ One of the best experiences I've had in a while_ Will definitely be back!",)("Alright so this place is great! Super intimate, shrimp and scallop wasn't over cooked_ Quick service, beautiful building_ Wasn't busy on Monday night_ We started with a Romana salad (Cesar salad), a Strawberry Gorgonzola salad, and a shrimp scampi_ Food came out quick even tho I only saw two or three kitchen staff on hand_ \n\nFor entrees, we got the lobster ravioli and a Pubblico pizza (prosciutto and arugula) the lobster ravioli is priced, but it comes out with two fat ass prawns and a damn scallop that's perfectly EFFIN COOKED_ I'm getting hyped right now just thinking about it__ great value!! \n\nThe lobster ravioli is loaded with meat, strong notes of rosemary, pasta is made in house_\nThe pizza, pretty good, the prosciutto was a little tough_ \n\nIf you're debating between mora and this place__ save yourself money and come here_ 2 people, lots of food, 73_ did not purchase dessert_\n\nTHANK YOU PUBBLICO_\n4 stars because the ravioli could have been hotter, also, there's a strange lingering bathroom smell or maybe cleaning product smell_",)("My family came here to celebrate my grandmothers 89th birthday_ They had a large table set up for us, and allowed us to bring in our own cake, which was a very nice gesture_ \n\nThe d cor was beautiful_ It felt very hip and modern_ \nThe staff was attentive and went the extra mile for our large group_ \n\nThough the restaurant has high chairs, they don't have a kids menu - which is why I docked a star_ It's tough to get a toddler to enjoy Butternut Squash Gnocchi when deep down he just wants chicken nuggets_ Also, kids menus are a great form of entertainment_ The amazing waitress brought him scratch paper and a pen, which I felt was above and beyond_ \n\nThis is a great spot to take a date, not a fantastic spot to bring your toddlers_kids_",)("We were invited to the pre-opening so we got to try a lot of different menu items that we normally wouldn't order_ All of the appetizers and salads were great_ The Shrimp Scampi appetizer was our favorite_ All of our entrees were also really good_ The restaurant decor and overall atmosphere were very nice & inviting_ I am definitely recommending this place to friends_",)('So we at here last night to test it out before we brought our husbands in_  We ordered a lot of food so we could taste multiple things (yes, we had left overs)_  We ordered the mozzarella carrozza, cauliflower steak polenta, butternut squash gnocchi and the beef risotto_  Every single dish was absolutely delicious!  Of course we had to end the evening with the scrumptious tiramisu_  Pubblico Italian Eatery is a WONDERFUL addition to our neighborhood and I look forward to dinning here again very soon_',)("My best friend had her birthday party here a few weeks ago on the patio and it was so lovely! The weather was perfect and the ambiance divine_ I was so excited when she picked this spot because I had been dying to try it_ It is such a great addition to 7th street, and walking distance from so many fun places to hit up after you enjoy a delicious Italian dinner here_\n\nTheir patio is small, but shady and perfect for a small group gathering_ There were about 24 of us who had dinner_ We took up pretty much the entire patio, there were a few more tables besides our party_ They had waiters walking around taking orders for the first hour while we drank and mingled_ My house chardonnay was refreshing and delicious! I ended up getting a second glass_ \n\nTo start, we tried their Antipasto Board that was absolutely incredible! It had an array of meats, smoked salmon, cheeses, veggies, hummus, and toasted flatbread_ It is a great starter for a table! While their homemade pasta dishes looked AMAZING, I was trying to stay on the healthy side since I had a week of indulging so I ordered the Cauliflower Steak Polenta from their Gluten Free portion of the menu_ It is so neat that they offer great GF options_ It was delicious! I did expect it to be a bit different (cauliflower in more of a 'steak' than florets) but the flavors were still fantastic_ It had roasted cauliflower on a bed of corn polenta and was topped with loads of wild mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil_ Then was drizzled with truffle and olive oil_ My ONLY suggestions were that the polenta be a bit creamier (it got a little tough and was kind of dry by the time it got to me) and that there be more of a 'sauce' on it_ Otherwise, I ate the entire thing and and enjoyed it! \n\nAll in all, this is a GREAT new spot and I can't wait to come back and try their homemade pastas_ The service was super friendly and they were so kind to do individual checks for our huge party which is no easy task_ I will be back soon! Also, the owner is SO passionate and was frequently making rounds to check in on all of the tables and offered great food suggestions_ Love that!",)("Was looking forward to trying this place out tonight and they said they weren't accepting any walk-ins until 8:30_ Seems sort of ridiculous! Don't think I'll come back to try it_ Very disappointed_",)('Very nice place with a sophisticated, but laid back vibe_  The pasta is cooked perfectly_  Chicken Parm is delicious but a huge portion that can be split easily_  Sneaky good bourbon selection too ELT and StgJr!!!',)("We made a reservation for this Hot & New restaurant in the 7th Street corridor last Thursday night to check it out!  We were seated at the best table in the restaurant___inside, but right at the doors to feel like we were outside_  The atmosphere was lively, the service was super friendly and fun and the food was delicious and hearty_  \n\nI started with an El Presidio cocktail with vodka, pear, grapefruit and elderflower (so yummy), shared a spinach salad with cheese, pancetta, mangos and tomatoes with my hubby (loved that they split it for us) and each enjoyed our seafood risotto and beef risotto too_  \n\nWe'll definitely be back when we're looking for Italian comfort food at reasonable prices!",)('Was there about a month ago and still thinking of the cauliflower polenta dish___amazing_ Superior food_  Superior service_ Cannot wait to go back!!!',)("Absolutely fantastic and you're hearing from a guy who avoids Italian like the plague (to me _Italian_ often means smothering white bread and pasta in red sauce and overcharging you for it)_   This place has variety, ambience, a great wait staff____antipasto platter is ridiculous but everything we had was great_  Try to get Jose as your waiter___you will not be disappointed",)("Before this space became Pubblico, it was a different restaurant called Okra_ My fianc  and I had been to Okra once before (terrible service, which is prob why it went out of business lol), but I loved the restaurant itself_ It has a great patio, and the look and feel of the restaurant is really fun_ So when my sister told me that Okra had been replaced with Pubblico, I knew we had to try it_ :) \n\nEven on a busy Friday night, we were seated right away_ Our waiter was super professional and friendly, and seemed like he had the perfect timing the whole night_ He would always come up right when we were ready to order something, I don't know how he did it! \n\nTo start, I had a glass of wine and my fianc  had beer - not a huge selection of either, but plenty to choose from at the same time_ We then ordered the Calamari as an appetizer, and it was delicious! We eat calamari everywhereee we go, and I thought the batter on Pubblico's was amazing_ Marinara sauce with calamari isn't really my thing, but this is an Italian restaurant so it makes sense, and the sauce itself was bomb_ \n\nFor dinner, we split the Pepperoni pizza - so good! It's not super big, but if you're not starving you can get away with sharing one_ They don't skimp on the pepperoni at all, and it was made perfectly with just the right amount of tomato sauce and mozzarella_ \n\nAfter dinner I tried the Italian Margarita, which was really good, but I wouldn't recommend if you don't like the taste of tequila! ;) \n\nDefinitely can't wait to come back again soon!",)('They just opened and will probably be around for awhile! Great food, friendly staff and convenient parking_ Party of four All had different entrees and salads as well as two appetizers___ All was great!

Even better, the bread was not overly toasted and hard_ It was just the right crispness to enjoy the bruschetta without damaging the roof of my mouth! Win win_ It was the Bresaola Fig & Tomato & Eggplant bruschetta that we had_ I thoroughly enjoyed both!\n\nThen I had the Lobster Ravioli whole my husband had the Lasagna_ He finished his entire lasagna with no complaints_ My Lobster ravioli also came with 2 jumbo shrimp and a jumbo scallop_ Done to perfection! The shrimp had ever the crispness to them that left me wanting more! And let me just say that the Lobster Ravioli had me feeling quite satisfied for the price!\n\nFor dessert, Tiramisu! Oh sweet heavens they actually got this right! Not all tiramisu's are equal_ Not too soaked, not too cakey_ Just right!\n\n\nThank you, Pubblico! We will be back!",)
