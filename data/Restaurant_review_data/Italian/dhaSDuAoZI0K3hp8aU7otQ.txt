("We found Dolce Vino by accident about 6 months ago and have been back a number of times since then_ The food is excellent with the exception of the chicken cacciatore on one visit that had shredded chicken and over cooked vegetables_ Not like any other I have ever eaten and I just won't order it again_ There are plenty of other offerings that are exceptional_ That one experience does not take away from our overall opinion of the restaurant_ It is a small place and the live music on Fridays and Saturdays is a bit much_ Very hard to have a decent conversation with others at the table_ In spite of this, Dolce has become one of our favorites_ It is not the easiest place to find and on a sketchy part of Glendale Ave_ but well worth the trip_",)('We have a new favorite Italian restaurant_  The food was fabulous_ It reminded me of my time living in Italy_ We will celebrate other special days here_ Like those ending in _Y_',)("My honey and I have dined at Dolce Vino three or four times since they opened_ We have, on all occasions, been pleasantly served lovely dishes that have been prepared with love and care by Ernesto and assistant_\nThe mussels are served in a yummy sauce that you will order more bread to sop up every last drop!\nThe sauces are all very appetizing whether it's the red or white_ Quality food at a comparable price point_\nThe wine selection is very nice as well, thank you Mr_ Tim :-)\nGive this restaurant a visit, you will be back!",)('Just ate here with the family, great authentic vibe_ The owner is Italian, speaks Italian and brings the real deal to the table!

The service was great, the food was excellent, and the ambiance was relaxing_  Both of us had house specials_  My wife had the lobster ravioli and I had the lobster fra diavalo_ Both dishes were superb!  You must save room for dessert however, because the tiramisu is out of this world good!!   Our server told us it is made in house and the chef spends a lot of time making it_ It was very light and creamy and not too sweet_ With a dearth of mom and pop Italian restaurants in Glendale we will definitely be coming back to this place and highly recommend it to all of you Yelpers!!',)("Cool little Italian restaurant with a laid-back atmosphere_ Not the cheapest place in town but pretty good food_ The live music on the weekends is pretty cool_ If you're in the mood for Italian this place is definitely worth trying!",)("Delicious!  On a Wednesday night with nothing planned my hubby and I were looking for a new Italian place to eat_ Dolce came up near by and we were on our way_ It's kinda hidden at night but worth it_ Walked in and a huge smile on my face as a piano player sat in the corner_ He's there Wednesday and Thursday nights_ And with live singer weekends_ The staff was friendly and very attentive_ We had the wine list available and the selection was above expectations_ We both had the chicken piccata and portions were excellent_ Prices  are comparable_ Just right_ We'll be back soon_",)('If you want authentic Italian food in the heart of Glendale, Dolce Vino is the way to go!
