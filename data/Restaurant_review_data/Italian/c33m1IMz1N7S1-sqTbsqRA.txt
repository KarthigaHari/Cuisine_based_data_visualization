('Great lunch special_ Got two slices of cheese and a drink for around _6 with tax_ Crust was terrific with great crisp and no flop_ Perfect ratio of sauce and cheese and the size of the slices were pretty generous and came out HOT_ Loved it_ Place is clean and the people were very friendly so it gets five stars, but rating the pizza 1-10, it gets an 8_5 from me_',)("Love this place! If you are looking for REAL New York style pizza then you will love it here_ The owners take pride in their food and we have never had a bad pizza_ It's the only place we will get pizza from around here!",)("Great place!!!  The food is amazing, the pizza, the salads, the cannolis,\namazing!!  They are family owned, which I love and so friendly!!\nI go there once a week, just can't stay away!!\nI have ate at other Ray's and everyone says they are not as good as them_  Well I am here to tell you they are better!!\nMy whole family is now hooked and this is our pizza joint for sure!",)('WORST PIZZA EVER!! Talked to another location owner of Rays Pizza on 35th ave and Union Hills_ These are not chains_ The location on 35th ave and Union Hills is the best by a longshot_ The owner_cook at Happy Valley skimped on toppings, sauce, customer service and he has a piss poor attitude_ At the 35th ave and Union Hills location their Monster Sicilian Pizza blows the Happy Valley pizza out of the water_',)("I'm actually pretty shocked there aren't that many 5 stars_ \n\nWell, I've been going here since they opened and I actually consider them to have one of the most authentic New York slices here_ Not like the fake _Grimaldi's_ New York style, but the kind that everyone references_ \n\nGrowing up in NYC myself, I thought it was good_ I've tried the chains of Rays and well___ they're a chain restaurant, I'll leave it at that! Lol_ \n\nThe owner of this pizzeria is actually blood relative of the original rays in NYC_l and is INDEPENDENTLY owned_ Makes sense now! \n\nI hope the other reviews don't stop you from trying out this great pizza joint_ \n\nPs_ You know it's a real pizzeria when they have garlic powder in a bottle for easy access",)("We live right around the corner and love to support any local businesses_ We have hit this place three times now and have been happy each occasion_\n\nYup, it's NYC style pizza and I'm a Chicago guy but, they do a very good job_ Crust is doughy and flavorful and toppings plentiful_\n\nService is fast and friendly - and it is definitely a family run place! Prices are right as well_\n\nOne knock - the wings are on the small side but we like the flavor so not much of an issue for us_\n\nOverall - Very good local pizza joint we are happy to put in the rotation!",)("Clean  great service food is awesome best cheese steak you could drive for hours and not get a better sub  refills on drinks  sports on 2 TV's good price also",)("I usually go to the one on Hayden_ Apparently they're not the same_  This pizza was most closely related to cardboard_ The pizza was ready quickly so I added a couple stars for that_",)
