enough to make any mouth drool from anticipation_\n\nI remained stalwart in my plans to consume a calzone, however, and ordered mine with pepperoni in place of the usual ham, as well as an addition of house garlic_ The calzone and stromboli both come in _small_ and _large_ sizes, but Ruth assured me that the _small_ calzone would, in fact, be quite large, and likely more than enough food for me_\n\nTaking her advice, I ordered the _small__ Not long afterward, the food was served and Ruth was NOT kidding_ The _small_ calzone here is easily comparable to the _large_ calzone at NYPD, if not just a smidge bigger_ It also comes with a good-sized tub of house-made marinara, which is something I always look for, because I like to use a lot_\n\nJudging simply from the smell of the calzone, I knew it was going to be delicious, and I was not the least bit disappointed_ Very honestly, the Basil & Garlic Bistro calzone was one of the very best I've ever eaten_ Not only that, I had nearly half left over to take home after eating my fill_ Asking for a box, Ruth was quick to bring one and even boxed everything up for me!\n\nWhen I gathered my things to leave, both Ruth and her coworker were on the phone taking orders, so I wasn't able to wave goodbye as I would have liked, but one of the chef's caught me leaving from all the way back in the kitchen and made a point of calling out a heartfelt, _Thank you - have a good night!_ Such a small thing___ But it actually meant a lot to me_\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor a quiet, somewhat lonely, winter night, I could not have been any happier with my visit to Basil & Garlic Bistro_ The setting is intimate and warm, the service was BEYOND exceptional, the food was spectacular, portions were significantly larger than expected, and prices were more than fair_\n\nIf you've never been to Basil & Garlic Bistro before, bookmark it!

Great owners Claudio & Nadine on the premises have built a fantastic local little hangout for traditional Italian dishes and pizza for lunch or dinner!\nI enjoy the BYOB & the bargain prices for excellent food with wonderful owners!! 5 stars!',)('Everything about this place is great! Super laid-back and excellent food! The staff was wonderful!

We went for dinner with my two year old and everything was amazing_  My mom and I split the grilled chicken salad and between the two of us we couldn't finish it_  We ordered penne with red sauce for my daughter and thought we might get a couple of bites, but she ate every bit of it!  Everyone that works there is really friendly and we have already been back for round two!",)('Meatballs are amazing as all the food us good_ The friendly staff always are welcoming and happy! Try the lasagna____ the beat ever!',)("A quaint restaurant and great place to take a friend from out of town_ Good Italian food_ The waitress wasn't as attentive as I'd like, but overall the experience was great_ Good Italian food_ \nThey do not serve liquor_wine_beer, but if you bring your own or purchase it from the convenient store next door, they'll charge you a corking fee and you can drink_",)('Just found this place, just in a residential neighborhood_  For some reason I really felt like a meatball sub today, so I searched Yelp for _best meatball sub_ and b&g showed up_ The 5 star reviews are not a mistake_  I got a hot meatball Parmesan Sub for me and my wife, we both loved it and want to go there for dinner this weekend_',)('Excellent food! Great family place to eat_ Wonderful owners_ Will be going every spring training and when we come visit family!',)('Meatball sub was delicious, as well as calzone oozing with cheese and wonderful dipping sauce! So affordable, excellent value!',)('We went to Basil & Garlic for lunch_  We heard about this place through a friend_  It turned out to be a great recommendation_  The only bad place and I feel bad for the owners is the location_  They are hidden in the corner of a strip mall in a neighborhood_  That being said, you need to seek this place out_  Very good service, the owners are very kind and thoughtful_  The bread served with your salad is fresh baked and ohhhhh sooooo good!!  The sausage parm with added onions and peppers were very good!\n\nThe chefs special is light, fresh and also very good_  I would have added more mushrooms, peppers and onions with the dish_  Lat lunch is the best time to go_  If you go during dinner, especially on  a Friday,expect a decent wait as there is not enough staff to handle the crowd_\n\nOverall, still worth a look!',)('Amazing little find in the middle of the neighborhood_ I was having a rough day and was stranded with vehicle troubles_ Decided to go eat while I wait and found Basil & Garlic Bistro_ This is a truly authentic Italian restaurant with great food that was so fresh_  Must make a  trip back here_',)("This is one of our favorite locally owned restaurants in north Scottsdale_ Every dish we've ordered there is outstanding_ My favorite is the chef's pasta_  And another good thing is that you can bring in your own alcohol for a cork fee_  Reservations are a must due to the small size of the restaurant_",)("Had the pleasure of checking out this place yesterday_ It's a small little family run place tucked in the corner of a small strip mall_ When you walk in you are greeted by the 2 owners who run the place and seem to do all the cooking_ They know what they're doing_\n\nWe ordered the b&g special sandwich which is baked chicken, roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, and pesto_ Awesome flavor_ I'm craving it right now just thinking about it_\n\nWe also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for my little guy_ It's was his first time having pizza and he loved it_ I loved it as well because I got the leftovers_\n\nMy wife ordered a _personal_ pizza_ It was more than enough for 1 person_ She added artichokes, broccoli, and eggplant_ The eggplant was strips of fried deliciousness_ I'm a carnivore but I loved it_ The wife was very impressed_\n\nAll in all this place is great_ Non-assuming family run place with amazing food_ The pizza is as good as any pizza I have ever had_ Can't wait to go back!",)("Just finished my second time at this restaurant_  I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 4, for a few reasons_  I had previously visited and sat on the patio and had a great experience and have really been anxious to return_\n\nThis place has great reviews but there are a couple things that deserve noting_  First and foremost, the food is very, very good which is obviously the most important thing and why I still feel they deserve 4 stars_  However, we waited a long time for bread that was hard with cold butter and no knives to spread it with_  We were absolutely starving and so we devoured it anyway_  I did not know it was BYOB-I'll have to note that for if I return_  We had to sit inside as it was extremely busy_  The inside is bustling with activity_  It does remind me of a little trattoria you might come upon in Italy_  But the staff is a little too casual-we heard more than a few curse words coming from the kitchen (with small children in tow)_  Also our waitress came in from the patio and was loudly telling the chef about a customer who was complaining about the way her chicken was cooked and they all proceeded to roll their eyes and bad mouth the customer, in front of us who were dining_  That is completely inappropriate_  We also had to ask for water numerous times_  And the bathroom hadn't been taken care of, lacking paper towels and what not_\nAs mentioned, the food is great but at this price point I feel they could improve on a few things_  I think they may have been understaffed but the paying customers shouldn't have to suffer by not having appropriate silverware and having to ask repeatedly for water_  I guarantee that wouldn't happen in Italy!\n\nThe bottom line is the last time I dined here I wished I lived closer so I could be a regular, and this time leaves me wondering if I will come back_",)('excellent food and I love you can bring your own alcohol! I bought some wine next door and the food was outstanding_  Small little place but so good_  Will go back again!!',)("This is a small restaurant with big flavors and highly recommended to everyone looking for classic pizza, calzones, stromboli's, sub's or Italian favorites from an east coast style pizzaria_ The owners are extremely engaging, husband is from Palermo, Sicily, Italy (probably the capital when it comes to Italian pizza makers in America and his beautiful wife is from Germany---should be interesting this summer for the World Cup)_ They check a few times with customers to ensure quality and complete satisfaction while dining_ Once you try their food you'll probably quickly become a regular, as I recently did_\n\nThey offer house made bread that is unique, served for meals and used for the sandwiches offered_ The pizza dough is expertly prepared and cooked to a nice crispness, the pizza sauce is not sweet like you find at many other local pizza establishments and the mozzarella cheese is the highest quality that melts perfectly on your pizza and sandwiches_\n\nThe Bistro is a little hard to find but located in a small strip shopping center off 92nd street between Shea and Cactus (formerly 2 Men and a Pizza)_ If you don't live nearby, it's well worth the trip from anywhere in the Scottsdale area if you're looking for the pizzaria you remember from anywhere east of the Mississippi_ \n\nI have not tried the entrees yet but they do offer quite a few on the menu and have seen numerous satisfied customers_ I hope you get by to meet the new owners soon_ Please remember, this is a BYOB establishment that does not serve alcohol_\n\nEnjoy, DeLaurentis",)("Woooow! It's like I was in a real Sicilian kitchen_ Don't get fooled by the strip mall setting and the simple decor, the food is delicious! Best Italian o have ever had_ The ingredients are so much better too-- it's not all the grease like at some places_ It's just deeelicious_ Family owned as well which is always a plus_",)('Bring your own wine here_ Call ahead for larger groups _\nDelicious meatballs and pasta_ This is a tiny place that has a few tables and is cozy inside_ If we had known be could bring our own wine we would have, apparently almost everybody else knew to BYOB_ I had a  chicken garlic bruschetta  that was tasty but had too much bread_ Fresh and delicious_ We will visit again!',)
