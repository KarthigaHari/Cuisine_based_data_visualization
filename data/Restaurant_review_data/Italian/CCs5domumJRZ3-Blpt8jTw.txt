("We decided to try this place after it changed to Denoras_  The Brooklyn style pizza was excellent but very small for the price_  We decided to try the NY pizza tonight and as I sit waiting for the take out, I notice that all of the outdoor tables are very dirty_  You guys need to step it up in the cleanliness area_ I'll report back on the round pie",)('Tea was stale, sweeteners had been wet and dried into hard clumps that would not dissolve_ Chicken Marsala gravy great but chicken tough and no pasta? Pot of mussels and garlic bread were spot on but not enough to warrant a return visit_',)("I used to go to the former restaurant here called Crust and it was just OK but the new Owner, DeNora's Ristorante, is EXCELLENT!!!\n\nI usually just order Domino's out of desperation but remembered this location and decided to give it a try_ The Owner was there and is extremely friendly and interested in her customer's satisfaction and the food was excellent_\n\nI had the Borough thin crust pizza, meatball sliders, fettuccine alfredo, garlic bread and a couple desserts_ I have eaten pizza and Italian food all over the Valey and this is hands down the best pizza in Town! I have no recommendation as to how the food could have been any better (a rarity for me) and am anxious to go back!\n\nLet's support this local business and make sure they prosper so we can all continue to enjoy their food for years to come_",)("I was a semi fan of Crust's before but I absolutely love love love the new menu of Denoras Restaurant! Service was amazing, very informative of new menu items__ love the family neighborhood feel_  A up! Definitely will continue taking my family here!!  FYI pasta dishes are divine!!",)("We decided to try Denora's late this afternoon for a to-go pizza_  (We use to regularly get take-out _Rustica_ pizza (_11ish) from previous owner when it was called _Crust__)  \nWe were really hoping to love this place_ \nWe ordered the Brooklyn thin crust Margherita pizza with meatball_ \nWe got home and opened the box and we were astounded at how small it was_ (and I mean SMALL!) They charged us _22_27_ \nI called them to confirm that they hadn't charged us for someone else order_  They said we were charged properly_\nI can confirm that we will not return_ The pizza was extremely disappointing_ Too many other great pizza places nearby to ever go here again_",)("Great neighborhood pizza spot!  Pepperoni Pizza was delicious and DeNora the owner was really nice_  Will definitely be back again_ Give this place a try the next time you're in the mood for Pizza_",)('Came to this place because a buddy was raving how good the pizza was_  Ordered the chicken and sausage_ Was delicious_  Had a few cocktails_ Great place_ Good atmosphere_  Great night with friends_',)('I was very impressed by the service and the quality of food that they have here_ The service was something that I have never experienced before, it was absolutely perfect_ The meatballs and pizza was amazing as was their burrata_ I will be back soon!!!',)("I ate here shortly after they opened under the new name_ I'm not sure if that is what the wait was so long (about 40 minutes from order to food) _ The food was average but one thing I had never experienced before is an Italian restaurant that doesn't serve complimentary bread with their entrees_ I had to order the garlic bread which was like _7 to have bread on the table_",)("DeNora's Ristorante is a small Italian Restaurant with a bar and a patio_ They offer Italian style dinners, a ravioli of the day and an assortment of pizzas_\n\nI think the sweet spot here are the pizzas________because those garlic knots we tried were absolutely delicious and I noticed other customer's pizza that truly looked amazing_____\n\nWhat drew me here was the dinner menu_ They offered some Italian Dishes you just don't find at most Italian restaurants_ In short the dinners we tried did not meet our expectations_ I note nothing was horrible but really both dinners weren't served as described_ I note I was also wrong not to tell the owner about my dinner but I didn't feel like complaining after my husband complained about his dinner_ AGAIN nothing was horrible but both dinners weren't prepared as they should be_\n\nThe owner seemed very nice and also was understanding_ She even took my husband's dinner off the bill when we asked her not to_\n\nI think the sweet spot here are the pizzas_\n\n I must rate this restaurant at three stars because I have some reservations_ Three stars means A-OK in Yelp and nothing is bad about a positive A-OK____",)('Love this neighborhood restaurant! Service is super friendly and food is great! Love the muscles and Brooklyn pizza! It just changed ownership and is so hands on! Happy to have a great place to have a nice glass of wine locally! My new favorite place!!!',)
