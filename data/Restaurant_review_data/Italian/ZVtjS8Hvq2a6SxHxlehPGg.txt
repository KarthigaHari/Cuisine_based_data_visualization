I noticed they accept reservations online via Open Table ___ Points People!  I booked it with ease_  Our reservation was for 7pm_  The minute we arrived the kind hostess called me by my name (score) and led us menus in hand to our very intimate table_  It was a Friday night, there was a large birthday party of about 12 people and a pretty crowded restaurant, yet, at no time did we feel neglected or uncomfortable_  The server was amazing_  The manager (owner maybe) came out to inquire about our meals and overall evening and invited us back again_  It was such a nice evening_  I do plan to return again with my new boyfriend_  *Smile* \n\nWe ordered the Baby Greens Salad to start_  It's simple but delicious with only spinach, roasted red peppers, herb feta and balsamic vinaigrette_  The herb feta was a really nice addition to the salad_  Next time I visit I'm going to try the Seafood Wedge_  We also shared an order of Calamari to start_  L'Amore serves both fried and saut ed calamari_  I've never had saut ed calamari so I stuck with the usual, fried Calamari with black garlic, red pepper and a pepperoni puree_  Again ___ Delicious!  Usually my mate and I would share an entr e if we get an appetizer but because the appetizers were so good and it was date night I convinced him to get his own meal_ \n\nI ordered Chicken Marsala with vegetables_  He ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables_  I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes but the Chicken Marsala ___ I thought about that dish days later so maybe that was my favorite_  It was cooked perfectly_  It was moist, seasoned so well, and needed nothing at all_  After sharing a bottle of wine, a salad and an appetizer, and our own entrees, we were happy and full so we didn't get dessert_",)("I'm so in love with this place !

I give them credit for giving free bread which many italian restaurant now charge for_ \n\nThe Chicken Parmigiana was an adequate portion for lunch as was the chicken marsala_  Both came with rigatoni (or ziti not sure) and the marsala dish came with veggies_  The marsala sauce had mushrooms in it and was not overly sweet_  That is my preference, but the person who ordered it, thought it to be a tad salty and not as sweet as it usually is_  After all, he said, _Marsala wine does have a sweetness to it__  The chicken in both dishes was prepared well--not overcooked_   The rigatoni were cooked perfectly _al dente_  the way pasta is supposed to be cooked_  The disappointment was the red sauce--the marinara sauce--And to us, the sauce is EVERYTHING!  It was too thick perhaps from using too much tomato paste and very oregano-y_  Too much oregano in fact_  Spices have to be used subtly so that no one herb or spice dominates to the point where the diner can call out what it is_  It is to be a melange of flavors married to each other and complementing one another_  So the sauce was not a winner for us_  Being originally from NY, we have had the best of the best  and have eaten sauces that blow your mind with deliciousness_   The dishes were _14 each, but if this had been dinner, they would have been _23_  So I'm glad we conducted this experiment at lunchtime_  \nI really liked the decor and the hospitality as one of the owners came by the table to greet us when we first sat down_  However, there was no goodbye_  Perhaps our assessment of the food was written in our faces_",)("Wow!!!!

They had live music and I love when restaurants do that_ The staff was also amazing! I felt as if the owner or manager was a little too involved with his customers and was in need of some professional restraint, but to each their own on that one_ I am leaving this review because of the HORRIBLE food to price ratio_ What exactly do I mean by that? Well the food quality WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I PAID FOR_ It genuinely was sub-par food and ingredients that I could have ran to frys and gotten_ I knew it was bad when I got a side of _steamed_ vegetables and it was nothing more than a few carrots and a very large piece of cauliflower_ The chicken was not butterflied or tenderized properly_ The only thing that struck me as genuinely good was the red bell pepper sauce under the strait from the freezer calamari_ My pasta was WAY undercooked and my girlfriends gnocchi was WAY overdone tasting more like mush than anything else_ For god sakes they didn't even grate fresh Parmesan over your food it was already ready to go(Cardinal sin in any Italian restaurant), and they cut THICK LONG slices of Parmesan over your food that didn't melt and took away all of the experience from the box made under cooked pasta_ All of this wouldn't be enough for me to leave a review if my meal in total for two people was _73?!?! Plus a tip of _10 (probably should have tipped more like I usually do but I was already pissed I had to leave _73 to this awful meal)_ In total came out to _73??!

Mmmmm",)('The atmosphere was relaxing for our Friday date night_  The food was excellent, fresh, had wonderful flavor and was comforting_  We will definitely dine here again_',)("With 32 reviews and 4_5 stars I had high hopes_ We were sorely disappointed_ \n\nThe Restaurant:  Dated decor, Christmas lights everywhere (in Feb)_ Poor layout_ \nThe Drinks:  bad wine and poorly made vodka cocktail made this a waste of time_ \n\nThe Food:  Mediocre would be a compliment_ The ziti and tortellini were terribly underseasoned_ The salad was lettuce carrots and oil_ Even the bread was subpar_ \n\nThe Service:  Our server started off well but went downhill fast_ No recommendations, MIA for 20 minutes and taking _the food wasn't too bad_ as a compliment made this experience unenjoyable_ \n\nThe Price:  There's not much worse than over paying for lackluster food_  I can cook better at home_ \n\nThe Verdict:  Any other Italian restaurant is a better choice_ Pick the next one_",)("I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!  We had a party of 5 on a busy Saturday night_  We had reservations and were seated right away_  The owners are on the floor helping the staff!  The food, customer service, and atmosphere cannot be beat!~",)("I came in from out of town and met a friend there_ It was busy but still it was easy for us to hear each other_ The calamari is not to be missed_ It is cooked just perfectly and is served over a delicious red pepper sauce_ I also had a Pinot Grigio and a Caprese salad_ Yum, everything was perfect! Don't miss this gem!",)("We had a need for good Italian_  Whipped out the handy dandy 'Yelp' application and did some intel on the area and came up with L'Amore Ristorante_\n\nGreat find!!  Owned by a lovely couple who are customer service focused and run a very nice establishment that warrants a visit from you_\n\nWe were seated quickly for lunch and we had a terrific server, Lena_  She was spot on for everything we needed and anticipated our every need_  Great start!  I wish I had the dinner menu as it looked really good as well_\n\nWe had the Eggplant Parm with their soup of the day_  The Eggplant Parm was very nice_  I had them add extra sauteed onions and bell peppers to the dish_ It elevated the dish to the point where I wanted more_\nIt is served with sauteed spinach and the dish was really good_  The only thing I wish they did was to add a small portion of pasta to the dish with their sauce_  It would be a bit more fulfilling_\n\nThe cheese Totellini was was also nice and had good flavor_  Next time, I would add a sausage and veggies to this as well_\n\nTo finish off a nice lunch, we had a slice of Lemonchello Cake_  Flavor-wise, terrific!!!  It just needed to be brought up closer to room temp as it was served straight out of the fridge and the cake lost some of its moistness_  If another way was looked at, on how to store this cake, so it is not so hard, when you eat it, it would be 100% perfection_\n\nI highly reccomend anyone to come and try out the tasty food at L'Amore_",)("Food was great, and even though they don't have a children's menu, they made my daughter a half-order of the chicken parmigiana_ This was our first time there, and we really enjoyed the food_",)('The atmosphere is nice and relaxed_  The food was terrific_  I truly wish I could give bonus stars cause this place deserves it!  You need to come here if in the area',)('The best Italian food I have ever had- the large group we came with all agreed_ The owners were there and were amazingly accommodating_ Thank you so much we wish we lived in AZ so we could return!',)("This place is the Hope Diamond of hidden gems! I grew up in an Italian household, so Italian food is as personal as it gets for me_ And this place does Italian well enough to please my grandmother_ My husband and I went for a romantic dinner, and we were not disappointed at the amibance of the place_ The owner himself was seating everyone and while it was an air of elegance, we also felt really welcomed_ Our waiter Julio brought us our menus and ice water right away, which was great because it was super hot out, even for Arizona_ We selected a Chardonnay from Fess Parker vineyards, and because we had a gift certificate from restaurants_com, we opted to split a bottle of it_ It was the first of many great decisions_ For our appetizer we split the antipasto for 2_ Incredible_ Fresh veggies that were perfectly roasted, cold, salty meats, sweet rich cheeses, awesome! Their fresh sourdough bread was a pleasure to eat, with that just right crispy crust and light, fluffy middle_ We both had the ceasar salad, which really prepped us well for our meal, as it was well sized and not overly dressed_  I ended up with the seafood risotto and my husband had the baked ziti with sausage_ We were stunned_ First of all, they came out HOT! Not the luke warm-ness that's becoming too common now, but truly hot! My husband loved his ziti_ He went so far as to say it's better the first baked ziti he ever had, which was on New York's Mulberry Street with his parents when he was a teen_ My risotto had so many layers of deep intense flavor I was beside myself_ Not overly full of seafood, but enough to satisfy the craving, the clams, mussles, scallops and shrimp were to perfection_ There was small peices of shredded lobster throughout_ The peas, red peppers and asparagus were done well, but not mushy and the rice was just al dente_ The saffron lobster bisque broth was intense in flavor but let each aspect of the dish shine through! As much as we were enjoying dinner, we decided to take half of each portion (very large portions, so bring friends or a large appetite or be prepared to take some home) home with us so we could have dessert_ I'm so glad we did_ We had the vanilla creme brulee_ You could actually see the vanilla beans in the custard_ And it wasn't overly sweet_ Too many are cloyingly so, but not this one! And it had a rather thick ring of the burnt sugar, which I liked, cause to me that's the best thing about creme brulee_ The owner, as mentioned by others, was all over the place, but always making time to sit and chat with his patrons to make sure they were happy_ Julio was fabulously attentive, not being in our faces, but our glasses were never empty and the pace was perfect_ We agreed this is a place we'll be going to at least once a month, if not more!",)
