("Was not impressed with the pizza_the Dell was raw very undercooked it was just an OK sauce nothing to rave about__ I come from a long line of pizza makers and i know good pizza when I taste it__ this wasn't close to being good very disappointed",)('Surprisingly great pizza from a food truck of all places_  I love the fresh local ingredients and they are getting their legs in terms of offering unique specials_\n\nThe crust is amazing on the outside, but just slightly too soggy in the center (still cooked) to give it 5 stars_',)("I stepped outside of my Food Truck Friday comfort zone (Short Leash) a few weeks ago to try something new, and decided on Pizza People_  \n\nThe posted wait time for a pizza was 10-20 minutes, but I waited a little over half an hour since it was quite busy_  I was fooled by the short line in front of the window and didn't notice all the people standing back from the truck waiting for their food_  I wouldn't recommend stopping here if you're on a time crunch for lunch, but if you can take a leisurely break, give it a go!\n\nI ordered the Fun Guy mushroom pizza, and it was certainly worth waiting for_  I love crust, and Pizza People make a fine and dandy crust!  It's light and crispy and buttery tasting_  Yum!  The serving size is quite generous for the price (_8_)",)('I just had some of the best pizza___tried the Fun Guy (mushroom) specialty and it was fab!  If you get a chance to try this pizza truck, you will not be disappointed!',)("I bought in on the whole gourmet food truck trend and had been to Food Truck Fridays a few times, but I gotta be honest that I was skeptical of pizza from a truck_ I'm also not afraid to admit when I'm wrong, and I was very wrong in this case_ The pizza wasn't just good for a truck_ It was just damn good_ Great thin crispy crust and lots of different, fresh toppings_ Will definitely be back",)('Had a chance to try this truck at foodiefest in Las Vegas the pizza was one of the best I ever had, the crust crispy, real mozzarella and fresh topping, the costumer service is great_ I will eat at this truck any time I can make it to Phoenix_',)("If you see the Pizza People Food Truck, stop and get a pizza_ Today, they were parked outside of the Coffee, Cookies, and Crafts event at Bragg's Pie Factory_ Lucky us! \n\nI'm a personal fan of the Popeye and Fun Guy_ The Popeye has spinach (obviously), basil, garlic, tomatoes and green onions_ The Fun Guy has mushrooms (get it?! FUN GUY? Because mushrooms are fungi_ You know, in the kingdom Fungi_) as well as arugula and basil_ Plus, the pizza dough is freakin' fantastic_ I could eat a pizza of crust_ \n\nAlso, there are vegan and gluten-free options_ But don't panic, carnivores! Plenty of awesome meat choices too_\n\nGuys, long story short, it's really good pizza_ You'll wait no longer than 12 minutes for your pizza, and pay no more than _10 for your meal_ That's _10 maximum_ Really, you'll probably spend _7 or 8, and that's including a drink_",)("I was stalking the Pizza People Food Truck all week to get a couple passes to Street Eats on Saturday and finally found the truck on my side of town_ Drove over to 48th St & University around 1145am and there was already a line formed_ Perused the menu board and honed in on the Popeye - spinach, garlic, mozzarella, and tomato sauce_ MaryBeth was busy taking orders and taking pies out of the oven_ She is very efficient and quick and had a smile for each customer_ I had my pie in 10 minutes or so_ I could smell the aromas thru the sturdy cardboard box while she handed me two passes (thanks, MaryBeth!)_ As I was driving back to the office, the smell overtook me and I couldn't wait and carefully removed a slice while I was rushing back over the highway - she pre-sliced the pie too! Gooey yummy mozzarella and the spinach was fresh, as well as the garlic pieces and tomato chunks_ The crust was perfect - crisp on the bottom and pillowy crisp on the edges_ Sooooooo good_",)("Saw them at an apt_ parking lot on Grove Pkwy in Tempe (they show up there on Tuesdays), and gave them a try_  First time I tried them had one of their specials, which had jalepenos and green chilis_  What I was impressed with is how light and crispy their crust is,  with a bit of chewiness to it_  The sauce had a good tomatoey tang to it, and the cheese was a really good quality fresh mozzerella (not greasy but had a nice cheesy saltiness to it_   Fresh jalepenos and green chilis gave it a nice kick_  The fresh basil was also a nice touch_ Overall just a high quality pizza_  And I'm super picky with my pizza, probably don't like 90% of the ones out there_   Second time I went to them,  had the Popey,  which had garlic, cherry tomatoes_  and garlic_  Another winner_  Pizza People makes some of best pizza in Phonix_  And the owners are super down to earth and nice as well_  I also had a side salad on my 2nd visit,  which for _1_50 was a steal_  Fresh mixed greens with a balsomic vinigarette_  The onions were a bit thick for me though  (I like mine sliced super thin)_   I will definately try to go a couple of time a month for my pizza fix_",)('We hired Pizza People to work our wedding and they did a great job! They were 1 of three trucks and everyone raved about them all night_ They were so great to work with and the staff on the day of me wedding was friendly and served everything quickly_ They even hooked us up with leftovers at the end of the night! It was great! Thanks again Pizza People!',)('Finally checked them out! Loved that they were by Shadys_ Schooners meats ___eight inch for 6 bucks with two toppings! The Side salad is amazing at a buck fifty!',)("Pizza People is really good_ I've tried their pizzas a few times and they're consistent_ The pizzas is ready quickly and their prices are super reasonable_ I like how they also cater to dietary issues and don't skimp on ingredients_ They offer lactose free and vegan options that taste great! Also, the staff is fantastic, super friendly and helpful_",)("I was worried because I am friends with the Pizza People_  And I love pizza_  And it is hard to find good pizza_  I mean I am impossible to satisfy_  So when I finally came to visit in Arizona I was worried_  What if it wasn't any good?  What would I say? Would I lie?  Yes, I would definitely lie_ But I didn't want to lie_  I wanted their pizza to be good_\n\nAs it turns out, it didn't really matter_  The pizza was awesome_  I mean really really awesome_  It was a relief_ But also a let-down because I was only in town for the weekend and then I had to go home again and now I can't eat this pizza_  I miss it_  I might miss it more than I miss my friends_  \n\nNow I have a new dilemma_  I want to go back to Arizona, but only to eat more of their pizza_  Do I lie and tell them I am there to see them and just hope they give me some pizza?",)("Kind of a cluster__  I stood next to the girl for over 15 min and she still ended up giving my pizza to some other asian girl_  Seriously??  So she chases her down and I get my pizza with some random girl's thumbprint on one section of my pizza_  Great_\n\nThat aside, I can see why this truck gets such high marks_  The crust is crisp yet chewy_  It actually kind of reminds me of Totino's pizza rolls because of the crust, sausage and general flavor of the whole thing_  Even the reddish grease_  I love pizza rolls__\n\nI would like to see nutritional info_  If its not as terrible for you as TPR I will probably stalk this truck all over town_",)("Finally, a fierce competitor in the Phoenix food truck frenzy! \n\nPizza People make an awesome pizza!  Very impressed with their selection of toppings- you don't do dairy, they offer daiya cheese_  Don't do wheat, they have gluten free dough_  Everything is made to order and fresh_  No sitting under a heat lamp for hours- what a concept and it is delicious_\n\nThe owners are very helpful if it is your first visit_  They have great energy, the concept has great energy and experience is good energy_  (Which is very important while digesting_)\n\nI will be returning soon!",)("Yum to The Yum for my Tum Tum Tum!!! (da-dum)  ( OK, that was corny_ )\n\nBut the pizza here is anything but corny_\n\nHad the _Hottie_ and it was very tasty_  Best pizza I've ever had off a truck, by far_ (wink wink)\n\nChewy, perfectly-done crust and all the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful_\n\nThe one critique I would make is that the crust gets a little thin in the middle and _sogs up_ a little before the end_  But that did not take away from the overall taste - this is a very good pizza under any grading system_ \n\nI will definitely hit this place again_  I was lucky to see them Tweet their location today and have it be just a few blocks from my workplace_",)
