('When we arrived at this restaurant at 4:30 on a Wednesday afternoon we were greeted by Jennifer a transplant from New Yawk!!!! Jennifer was our introduction to an evening of delicious food along with her great service_ She treated us like we had arrived into her own dining room! The way she described each dish had our mouths watering! The 6 of us chose different dishes along with 4 appetizers and we all shared a cannoli_ We were told to stay at the table as long as we wanted_ She was gracious and kind and even shook our hands and hugged us as we left! If we lived in Scottsdale we would come here often! You should too!',)("Don't let location prevent you coming from this neighborhood Italian restaurant_ Great happy hour, wine menu, and meals_ Had soft shell crab special_ Delicious_ Service was amazing_ We will be back!",)("La Cucina is a hidden treasure:  My girlfriend and I decided to try it on a whim, and were served outstanding, rustic Italian dishes (including perfectly-prepared softshell crab) by a knowledgeable, attentive wait staff_  We barely managed to save enough room for dessert, which included an excellent, made-on-premises tiramisu_  The server's wine recommendations were also spot-on_   I can't say enough about the quality of the food and the cozy atmosphere_  Dollar-for-dollar, this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the entire Scottsdale_Phoenix metroplex, despite the humble location next to a supermarket and a nail salon_  Highest marks!!",)('This is by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to! I loved everything that my party ordered, the bread came out warm and fresh, and the chicken Parmesan was the absolute best I have ever had_ I loved the small little hometown feel, the employees were all very nice and took good care of our party_ The owner came out and was talking and visiting with some of the customers and he stopped by our table and had a nice little conversation with our table as well_ It was a great meal, great atmosphere, and did I say great food! It was good lol',)("Super cozy wonderful neighborhood gem_ Stopped in tonight to check it out_ The bartender, Jennifer I think, couldn't have made you feel more welcome_ Tried the happy hour chianti (_5) which was good but for _3 more the Pinot Noir was outstanding_ She recommended the eggplant torte (_5 on happy hour) and the portion was generous and delicious_ Definitely plan to be back!",)("I usually don't write reviews but had to for this one_ It is the best hidden gem! If you love delicious Italian food, this is your place! Beyond amazing food, staff, and ambiance_ It's our new favorite place and feels so homie!!

Wait staff was very friendly and accommodating_ Decent wine list_ Pricing isn't too bad, probably in line with North Scottsdale_  The only negative is that it's really loud inside_  Loud enough to make it hard to hear the person you're with otherwise it would be a solid 5 stars_",)('We love this neighborhood place_ Very family oriented_ George, the owner, is great and very personable_ Jennifer and Anna Marie make the place run smoothly_ This part of north Scottsdale needs a place like this!',)("Wonderful food and the staff was very helpful! A great selection of wine and lots of specials to choose from as well_ Not at all what you'd expect from a place located in a strip mall_ I'll be back!",)('A delightful place with a friendly owner_ The cannoli and the spaghetti and meatballs were amazing_ The _seafood pasta_ was well worth it_ Will be back_ Definitely worth trying_',)("This is my neighborhood go-to restaurant_  The food is excellent, the staff super friendly,  and always feel at home_  Favorites are softshell crabs on bed of linguini_  Delicious_  The rack of lamb, the osso bucco, and all of the seafood dishes are super_  Haven't had a single bad dish here, met lots of people who are now friends_  Way above any expectations_  Give it a try_  You won't regret it_",)("It took me a few days to get this review up but as a former waitress I felt it necessary to write about our experience here_ First_ I will say that the food was good, the service was great, but the distractions were endless_ The restaurant was not too busy and the waitress was very friendly, but the noise was so disturbing_ There was constant pounding in the kitchen that is only separated by a thin curtain, and the only thing we could hear over the pounding was some man (Im pretty sure was  the owner ) yelling at everyone in the kitchen, at one point it looked like the waitress coming from behind the curtain was going to cry_ He would come out and even stopped by to greet us with a polite Hi which I thought was nice, but it was oblivious it was a fake smile cause he turned around and berated the waitresses, in the middle of the restaurant with no regard to the customers (yes we can hear you yelling at your crew)_ Honestly, It was embarrassing, and I'm sure the servers felt completely belittled_ I used to be a server so I pay attention to the little things, I felt horrible for the ladies working and if you need to give your crew a correction, do it privately_ It was apparent this guy was either angry all the time or he had a horrible staff, based on my experience with the waitresses I don't think that the staff is the problem, However, It killed the experience cause I was so busy looking at who he was yelling at, it is such a small place it's impossible to just ignore all that noise_",)('We stopped by for Happy Hour_ The service was as amazing as the food on the HH menu, especially the bruschetta board_ And the bread___WOW_',)("The food is ok but the staff Is what makes the experience_ The problem is the owner!!! He is basically just not a very nice person_ The way he treats his staff is demeaning, degrading and with absolutely zero respect_ Doesn't matter if he is the owner_ No one has the right to treat other people that way particularly in front of other people_customers (frequently done)_ Shows lack of character & business acumen_ Do yourself a favor and avoid this drama ladend atmosphere_ Doesn't make for a pleasant dining experience and the food really isn't that good_  Would have given a 0 if was an option_",)("Let me preface this with I grew up in a 2nd generation italian-american? household, so my grandmother made this kind of stuff and that's  hard to beat_ The service was incredibly friendly and informed___the wait staff knows their menu and wine list and it shows_ The entrees definitely demonstrated that someone in the kitchen cares but just didn't live up to the reviews_ It was pretty good; not great and for the price I would definitely seek out something with hopes of a better outcome_",)('Pretty good, but a _9 bottle of wine costs _48, and i had spaghetti and meatballs __ meatballs were very bland, i didnt have hardly any spaghetti, more sauce then anything_  Bread is fabulous_',)('Love this neighborhood Italian restaurant!
