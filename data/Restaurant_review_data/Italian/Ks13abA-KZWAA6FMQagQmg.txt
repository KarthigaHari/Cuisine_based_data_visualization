If you're from NY, don't bother, you'll be extremely disappointed_ check the expiration dates on canned_bottled goods as well, they seem overstocked and can't possibly have the turnover of inventory to maintain freshness_\n\nAs a 30+ year customer that is originally from Brooklyn, I was appalled_ Jason B_ must be from Kansas, to talk about being _cultured_ and _old world quality_ strikes me as someone who hasn't a clue_\n\nI give Tony's two stars solely for ambiance, but as to quality, I'd rather eat a scorpion_",)("So, I am new to the Sunnyslope area and work nearby_ Choices when you have a half hour lunch are pretty slim around here_ We have Jack in the box, McD's and a Subway_ I had never seen this little place because it's so well hidden_ A friend who lives in the area recommended I try their sandwiches_ Since I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things I walked on in_ The deli is quite the interesting little place_ Italian posters have taken over the store and it's kept dark_ They seemed to have a vast array of authentic Italian foods for cooking at home_ The menu offered variety of sandwiches as well as pizza (sold by the slice) and spaghetti_ I settled on a salami sub_ Wow, I have never realized a sub can taste SO good!! The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick_ Everything tasted quite fresh_ The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red_ The prices are great_ What I could tell a sub runs 2_50- 4_00_ Well worth it for its size_ They also have the option of getting a side with your sub_ While waiting for my sub to be prepared I did grab an orange Italian ice from the freezer_ Once at work, I found it had no taste_ It was just orange colored ice_ All in all, great experience! Can't wait to try some more sandwiches!",)("This review is composed as a companion piece to the other positives on this page, so please read those for details I won't repeat_\n   I think Jason B_'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place_ And, while I find Nick S_'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either_\n   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the _European Standard__ So ,if you've ever been, you know_ If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to _pass_ on visiting Tony's_ I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters_ Do you do calamari, or not?\n   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience_ I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service_ Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask_ Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto_\n   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry_ Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least_ Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me_ See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w_some past friend or relation_ Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09_\n   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste_ I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced_ I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown_ I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else_  It happens_\n   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide_ I _second_ the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @_2_15 is a bargain_ (compared to _7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried_)\n   Another bargain here is the bulk olives_ While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome_ With jumbo plain greens @_3_50lb_, and Greeks priced at the upper end of _5_49lb_, you can pay _11 and up for the same thing elsewhere_ Let the Snoot in you decide_\n\n   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives_\nThey're black_ They're ripe_ They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny_ They're salty,(very) not sour_ They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex_ They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious_ They're addicting_ They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic_ They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats_ They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime_ And they're _4_49_ Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home__ Where the heart is___ OR, you can eat them like candy_ Try at least ONE in your lifetime_\n   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not_ If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home_ Makes a world of difference_",)("Yesterday I tried Subway's new _Italian hero__  Let me spare you the _9 mistake_  Tony's special Italian is so far superior, and cheaper_  My day is always better after I've eaten one of his special Italian subs_",)('Such a great authentic deli_ Huge sandwiches, like literally 6 feet long, and all the favorites from the homeland_ Cute and quaint all the way_',)("I'd been going to Tony's for 40 years - since I was a teenager_ They make the absolutel best Italian sub_hero sandwich I've ever had_ Lot of meat and cheese and a large, fresh roll_\n\nSo, why only three stars?
