We can't wait to come back & try some of their pasta dishes soon_ Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading us here!!",)("Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!\nWhen we moved into the downtown area___ we ordered a pizza from here to be delivered on moving day_ \nIt was so delicious, I almost inhaled it! \nThe crust could have been a little bit crunchier (seemed a tad bit soggy from sitting in the box_) -- but, still NOT BAD_ \nThe sauce was delish___ the cheese tasted fresh___ and the basil on top added the perfect flavor! \nIt was more pricey than a typical pizza chain___ but, definitely worth it for the taste_\nI'd like to visit the actual restaurant sometime soon!",)("I would love to offer a positive review for a grass roots local joint, but my third and final trip to this restaurant cements my initial impression - mediocre at best and not worthy of another visit_  Not sure what other reviews were about - I would love a more Italian, authentic product like they seem to be attempting to provide - wood fire oven is definitely a step in the right direction_  But the only good thing I've ordered here was the Pizza Margherita - tough to screw that up - pretty much a glorified Italian cheese crisp___Last go round my pizza was piled with no less than an inch of arugala - most of which was wilted and looked gross - covered with a thin layer of fresh arugala_  Asked the waitress about it and her response?  It works_  Nuff said_",)("It's true, the pizza is where it's at_ I can only comment on the margharita and the siciliana (eggplant) and they are just really damn good_ The sauce tastes like my dad's and the crust is perfectly chewy and yeasty_ The mozzarella is there, but it is perfect and not rubbery, greasy or overpowering_ They seem to know what they're doing with the seafood specials too_ \n\nWe've done BYOW(ine), but recently they offer a couple selections now_ You can still bring your own though! I miss the owner though with the Italian persona that would fill up the restaurant_  He seems to have been replaced by the bald awkward one that was usually serving in the past but is now the manager_ That's ok_ He's a good guy_ The owner is still in the picture but seems to be on to bigger and Scottsdalier things at the new location_ I will keep coming to this little spot, probably with my parents (parents LOVE this place) and try the home-made pasta next time_",)('This was awesome pizza, bread, and service!!  We picked this place from Yelp and was not disappointed!!  Highly recommend!!',)("It's not even close_  Best pizza in Phoenix_  I work close by and pick up pizza often_  Every time I introduce someone to this place, their hooked_   Stay away_  I don't want this place to get too popular_",)("What a nice surprise!  I heard about this place on Open Table and then did some research on Yelp and quickly realized I better get my butt over to this amazing place!  I checked it out for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised_  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside and there are very few tables inside, but the food speaks for itself!  The staff was all very friendly and willing to please_  The bread and tomatoes were amazing to start and my pasta was just delicious!  The 4_5 star overall review for this place is definitely warranted in my book!",)("Love this place! My hubby heard abt this place thru yelp & When I first saw the location, it didn't necessarily have the best curb appeal_ However, the decor and intimate size of the dining area makes up for it; especially the food_ I've had the pepperoni and the margarita pizza, and we've had the lasagna & shrimp pasta dish_ No complaints whatsoever_ :) the appetizer, bruschetta is Delish_ I guess what I'm implying is that I haven't been disappointed! \nI personally prefer their pizza over pizza bianco_",)('Stopped by with co-worker for late dinner, and we were not disappointed_ Very good food and highly recommend_',)("I dropped in a while back on National Cheese Pizza Day and wasn't disappointed_ I went with their Margherita pizza and they brought out some bread with a bruschetta style dip that was outstanding, all for around _12!! I was very satisfied with the food and the price was an added surprise_",)("I've heard of this place for years when I was going to culinary school down the street_  Everyone raved about the pizza  I  had a small pizza today big enough for two people and some great bread bites great place to have lunch",)("In a reasonably late scramble for dinner, this pizza place was quite a find_\n\nThe location isn't altogether promising, right next to a Circle K and tucked in an itty bitty end in a strip mall_ There are only about 7 table_ Yet the owner, whose service was excellent, makes the most of the situation_ \n\nThe wife and I split a margherita pizza_ Out first, though, is the appetizer, which was small pieces of pita-like flatbread served with balsamic vinegar served over a tomato and celery salsa cruda_ Nom_ Worth eating in for_ \n\nThe pizza itself was a thin crust___ The crust was decent, the cheese was good, and both the basil and tomato very fresh_ It must be nice having ready access to fresh versions of both year-round!\n\nWe were very happy with our meal_ Pizza A Metro should be on your short list for a good Italian pizza in the area_",)("Don't get the negative reviews_ Yes, the location in the Circle K strip mall lacks the aesthetics_ The place is tiny_ But the pizza? Beyond wonderful___hand tossed, brick oven baked, melts in your mouth_ The friendly waiter told me they  also have an upscale place in Scottsdale so if that's important to you, go there_ I'll keep going to Thomas Rd and enjoying the best pizza in town_",)('Mama Mia! what are you a doing here? \n\nI was leery to say the least coming to this part of town with my boss for lunch_ It is in a small strip mall where the _99 store even found a need for metal bars on the winnow_ This is not your typical location for fine dining_ \n\nExternal appearances inside you are met with a small dining room with nice tables and chairs (no table cloths_) Note seating is limited to 4 four person tables and two 2 person tables_ \n\nThe menu us full of Italian food like pastas, not just pizza_ \n\nDue the name of this place I had to try the pizza, I went with a small vegetarian (_10) It had everything on it, including artichoke, eggplant, olives and more_  For a small it is a good size, this with a app or salad would be good for two_ Big me only ate half_\n\nMeals include and amazing bruchetta, the flat bread is hot straight from the wood oven, the bruchetta is full of flavor and is fresh_\n\nMy bosses spagetti and meatballs (8_95) were artfully presented and, as I could see the kitchen cooked and sauted to order_ He enjoyed his meal as well_\n\nIf you are looking for some great food in a very unexpected location give this place a try_',)("Don't be deceived by the neighborhood of lack of curb appeal, this is a great restaurant!  I was out on a business trip and used Yelp to guide me___ I was not disappointed_ \n\nWe ordered the small (12_) Margherita & a small Siciliana (cheese & eggplant pizza) they were both amazing_ Though friends Siciliana was tastier, you can't go wrong with either one_ \n\nThe table next to us ordered pasta dishes and all we kept hearing is _delicious_!  They stared at our pizza when it came and remarked on how good it looked___ they were right_ \n\nThe Italian Wedding soup we ordered as an appetizer was a but bland but not terrible_ \n\nThey brought a complimentary appetizer of pita slices & a type if onion relish dip - very yummy!\n\nThe tiramisu was also quiet yummy_ Overall a good experience - totally worth a visit___ or multiple visits_",)('Wow where  has this place been  and why have I not seen their sign before?\n\nI know everyone has already reviewed and oohed and awwed , which it deserves_  But I  am going to give it a  better rating , it tasted great and my daughter liked it!   Yeah!  My nine year old  enjoyed it and it was good for  her_  Now we have a place to stop for a bite before getting on the freeway_',)("Delish! I went here for lunch after a coworker recommend it, and I ended up eating myself silly_ I had the Penne alla Vodka, which was wonderful (but if you don't like salty sauces, maybe not for you) and the tiramisu was very light and fluffy_ The cons are: the inside is tiny, so there only a few tables; parking is also limited; the service was a little slow_ Still, though, the food is phenomenal_",)("I love the fact that the clientel varies from business professionals to painter_construction workers, obviously with a taste for good Italian_  The Italian Wedding soup was delicious_  With sliced meatballs and a poached egg_____ it's a meal in itself_  The complimentary pizza crust with tomatoes in vinegar was a very nice touch_ \nFor my 2nd dish I ordered the Caprese salad and it was delicious as well_ Fresh- plentiful mozzarella on top a bed of greens and tomatoes_ Yum!!  So much food I had to take a bag home, oh Shucks!\n\nIt's a tiny intimate space with very good service and a great big mural that may be torn down when they expand_  Check them out while their still small!",)("I was excited to eat here after reading all the great reviews I was soooo ready to eat what many people said was one of the best meals ever_ Before my food arrived I was given some bread to munch on and it looked really good I took one bite and remembered Patricks review of the dough tasting like tap water_ Patrick was right_  The pizza dough tasted the same and I was crushed_ Is there something wrong with me and Patrick? Why doesn't everyone else taste what we taste? I will be going back to try out the entrees and I will update my review",)('Well, \nThis is my next stop searching for that pizza I have been missing since I moved here_ Even though food here is good, I am still searching! The most amazing thing about this place is the location_ Never knew it could exist at that place_',)("This is one of my favorite spots_ I work downtown and usually make it here once a week or every other week_ I came here and was happy to order chicken Marsala and hear a few minutes latter the chief pounding chicken cutlets, reminded me of home_ Fresh and on point, the Alfredo is out of this world and the pizzas are the same_ They have a large brick over to cook there pizza and the pizza comes out thin crust as if it was made in a bakers pride oven_ Don't let the outside deter you, once inside it is a very modern romantic look with a few tables_ Great date spot or place to pick up to go_ One last thing, every time I go to Pizza a metro the service is some of the best I've experienced in the food industry_",)
