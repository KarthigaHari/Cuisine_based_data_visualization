("To start, you should know that I am not the biggest lover of  Italian food_  My boyfriend is of Italian decent, so sometimes I never really have a choice about what genre of food is for dinner_  \n\nThat being said, I LOVE LOVE Basilico_  He never has to convince me to go for Italian___ I crave Basilico!!  It is not only right near my house, but is the best Italian food in the Phoenix Metro that I have had_  \n\nRose, the owner and our waitress, is wonderful - always inviting and friendly!  Since the first time we dined, she has remembered what we like and even what I drink_  As for the food, the execusion on all the dishes are precise ___ the homemade pastas are tender and cooked perfectly and the specials are always a great choice_  I am confident that you could order anything and will be completely satisfied_\n\nBasilico is a hiddent gem and I am always amazed that it's not jammed packed with a wait list_  After one visit, I am sure you'll become a regular_ _ _ I know I did_",)('Moved to Prescott and Now called Rosa Pizzeria on 330 Gurl',)("So, the restaurant that my friend is always raving about was where we went_ Basilico was an experience from the second I walked through the door_ As a lover of Italian food, if it's not authentic, it's not for me_ My meal was by far the best Italian food I've had in years! Other than the food, the ambiance was perfect_ Very friendly yet professional_ I knew I was in for a treat the second i smelled the toasted bread and the refreshing pesto_ I ordered the chicken parm and every bite got better_ So tender and delish_ My friend had me try her penne with vodka sauce and I will say that it was definitely the best vodka sauce ever! The pasta was al dente and so fresh___yummm\n\nIf you want true authentic Italian in Scottsdale, hands-down Basilico does it right_",)
