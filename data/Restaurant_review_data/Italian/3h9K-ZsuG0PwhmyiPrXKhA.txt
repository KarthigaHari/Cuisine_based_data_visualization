("This place is fantastic!\n\nYou can't go wrong_ \n\nOwner seems like a great guy super friendly and thanks you for your business_\n\nChicken Parm sandwich best i have ever had_",)("I love this place, it is the best Italian in the area and is one of my favorite lunch spots_ The sandwiches and pastas are spot on and the service is wonderful_ in the modd for dessert? Try the oh-so tasty brownoli - brownie with cannolli filling, it is to die for_\n\nWhen I visit, I tend to stick with my standby, their solid meatball parm sandwhich_ Their meatballs are the best I have had in Arizona and taste wonderful with their homemade mozerella (which you can buy fresh daily)_\n\nThe owner is generally the man at the counter and he greets you with a solid Chicago Italian hello that makes you feel like you are at the windy city itself, minus the horribly polluted river_\n\nHave no reservations about coming here, you'll love it_",)("A wonderful new option for lunch in Scottsdale!\nI stopped in on their second day open and my experience was flawless_ It was a Thursday and the special was Italian Beef with Au Jus_ I had to try it_ I ordered the half size for (_4_25) and it was plenty_\nIt arrived piping hot with melted mozzarella on really great Italian bread_ The Jus was the best I've had outside of my ma's kitchen and the sandwich was perfection_ The beef was so tender with no bits of fat_\nThe restaurant is small and clean_ The owners are the real deal_ They were making sure everything was just right_ \n\nI am so excited to have this wonderful option for lunch with a great price point (_4_25 - _9_95) and amazing food_ They have daily specials that are awesome_",)("I was visiting the Scottsdale Gun Club recently and decided to grab lunch afterwards_ I ended up going to _Pasta-N-More_ because it looked like a delicious local small business, the type of place I love to support_ The outgoing owner instantly welcomed me into the restaurant, and his staff all treated me like a member of the family_ I knew from the first moment when I walked in that I had found a new favorite weekly spot to get lunch! The prices were reasonable and the menu was massive_ \n\nI tried two items because I couldn't make up my mind, the sausage roll and the meatball sliders_ The sausage roll was amazing; think of it like a new twist on the traditional calzone_ The meatball sliders were equally mind-blowing, truly one of the best ideas I have ever heard of! If you like meatballs or sliders you have got to try these! \n\nThis place is one of the cleanest and friendliest small businesses I have been to in a very long time_ I was honestly surprised to see how clean the tables and soda machines were_ This is not common in restaurants these days! No one takes the time to do this anymore and it drives me crazy! This place will put any _supposedly_ clean restaurant and soda fountain to shame! I guarantee it! This is one of my big pet peeves, and I always make a point to check the machines and tables out_ Take a look for yourself and order some sliders while your there!",)('I tried this place after reading such rave reviews and was with expectations of finding a nice little hole in the wall Italian sandwich and pasta shop_ Unfortunately I was very disappointed to find very generic and _ or canned flavors in the sauces, portions to price ratio also a disappointment_ I ordered a chicken parm sub and what I hit was a toasted nun with a scant amount of chicken, melted cheese, and generic marinara that I have eaten in several places_ My wife orders the cheese ravioli with meatball and was equally disappointed_ The ravioli tasted like generic Costco pasta, the meatball had no spices to flavor the meat, and the sauce was the same generic commercial stuff as well_ I believe the owner took our order and he was very nice and accommodating_ The problem is that a smiling face does not make up for mediocre food_ Overall just a let down as I had anticipated more authentic flavors_ By the way, the two portions mentioned and a soda for _19_ Too much for a lunch style place considering small quantities and lack of authenticity_ Not a repeat in my opinion_',)("I've been here a few times_ The quality of the food was honestly not as good as the Italian joint I had dinner at in the theater district of Manhattan, but I'm not some Yelp snob who complains about places not being _authentic_ enough when I've never been to Italy in the first place_ The owner has a very lively New Yorker-ish personality and a booming voice_ He greets you, takes your order, and is overall a very friendly guy who treats all of the customers well_ If this guy ever treats you like crap, then there must be a serious glitch in the system_ Everything I've tried here came out pretty quickly, even when there were other large groups of customers, and everything tasted fine_ My eggplant parm was also incredibly big for a lunch-sized serving_ Overall, it's a neat little lunch place if you happen to be over in that area_ Hopefully it manages to stay open longer than the other places that occupied this spot_",)("Bobby is back!  A different name but the same outstanding food!  The service and food is the best_  When you walk in you get the aroma of fresh garlic & Italian Food cooking and a huge greeting from Bobby!    I just don't know what to order when I'm there because everything is so delicious_  The chicken parm is one of my all time favorites_  Love the pasta & salads too!  Love, love, love this place!!!!!  PS try the garlic knots_",)("The Best East Coast Italian food you will find in AZ_ Bobby Who's better than You!!",)("If you love Italian food, THIS is the place to go! The food speaks for itself, I could eat it everyday_ From the salads to the sliders- OMG!!! I love the Eggplant Parmesan, I actually crave this food_ The garlic knots are awesome and you kind of get a show out of the owner_ His catch phrase- _hey- who's betta than you?_ Nobody!____ \nGreat prices-, very, very reasonable!  The owner could easily charge so much more for the big taste you get out of this food_ Italian food is my favorite so, I've been to so many_____I've been to the little hidden spots to  Italian restaurants that are _high end_ and they're excellent- but you pay through the nose- -THIS food is so much better and ,as I stated above reasonably priced_ Oh save room for the dessert___kind of like a brownie with cannoli _stuff____EXCELLENT!!!",)("It looks like all of the bogus orange head 5 star reviews couldn't save this place_ I saw that the sign was no longer there and the place was closed for lunch on Friday_",)
