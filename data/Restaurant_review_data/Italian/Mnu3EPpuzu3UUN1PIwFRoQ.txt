('Absolutely love this place_ The fettucini alfredo is off the chain!! Get it with build your posta option ( Mush_broccoli & Chicken my favorite)_ I  can assure you that they gotta little Maui in the pasta!! The staff was great its Chef driven_',)('New place_ Needs to work out the kinks_ _7_95 for 2 medium sized meatballs served luke-warm with garlic bread and a small salad_ _2_75 for a 12oz can of Diet Coke_  Not a very good value_',)("Yummy lunch_ They had three complimentary dips to try and all were great_ I loved the artichoke_ I ordered the lunch express baked ziti and it was delicious_ It came with  a salad and homemade focaccia_ So good!  I'll definitely be back!",)("I've tried a couple of Italian restaurants in the area, looking for something to reach the standards of my Italian grandmother's cooking, and I've definitely found it here at Maui Pasta! These are some very classic Italian recipes and apparently the chef cooked in Italy for a few years! You can tell they use authentic ingredients too_ At a really great price! I'm very pleased with my meal and service and will definitely come back here soon!!!",)("They clearly have good intentions and are trying___nevertheless, after visiting Maui Pasta for our 4th dinner experience since opening early in April, we've decided to give up___ The Bolognese sauce is pretty good, the Caprese salad is fine, the pastas are OK, a tad bit overdone for my taste; but I'm a bit disappointed in a restaurant that serves Italian pastas and doesn't have fresh ground pepper available for their diners, nor do they offer any ground cheese___and when we asked for some cheese they brought us essentially a teaspoon of grated parmesan___Duh!  And I have a major disagreement with ordering our meal at the front counter and being asked to make a decision on the gratuity before experiencing the food or service___ That's just very inconsiderate to the patron____and frankly, it's dumb_  We wish them well, but will not go back_",)("Mother told me if you cant say something nice don't say anything at all_ ________________seriously folks, 7 employees trying to look busy, while I, the ONLY CUSTOMER, is waiting for a cold cut sandwich_ 20 minutes,,,I looked back in the kitchen cause I thought they were waiting for Jimmy Johns to deliver it_ But, there was a cook_  The sandwich was good but 20 minutes?  The manager, I assume he was the manager because he was the only adult, came up to me to ask how I enjoyed my lunch_  I told him if it takes much longer to prepare you can ask me how I enjoyed my dinner_ \n\nWhat I really don't understand is why they serve a sandwich for take out on a nice plate_ I included a picture of my sandwich, on a dinner plate, sitting on the front seat of my car_",)("The food here is fabulous_ You can build your dinner by picking your pasta, sauce, and top_ I had the spinach fettuccine with bolognese sauce,and eggplant parmesan for the topper_ It was delicious! My three companions enjoyed their food as well_ Everything is made fresh onsite including three kinds of cheesecake_ It's casual but nice- you order at the register, and they bring the food to you_ They don't serve wine, but we brought a bottle of wine and paid a five dollar corking fee_ I'll definitely go back_",)("So far I've only eaten here twice, but I can already tell you how much I love this place_ Their pasta is so good- this is no generic Olive Garden type food_ The cheesy garlic bread is absolutely amazing, I don't think I'll ever come here without ordering it_ I've seen some reviews complaining about time spent waiting for food, but this isn't McDonald's so you need to have some patience_ From my experience the wait wasn't even bad at all, it was appropriate for what I had ordered_ I often find pasta bland and boring, but theirs is not like that at all_ I'm excited to keep exploring the menu as I come here more_ I could definitely use an order of that cheesy garlic bread right now!! Keep up the good work guys, you're doing great (especially for a newer place)_",)('We had high hopes, I had the stromboli lunch express, the meat was cold inside and the bread tasted like it had flour on it, another had the prosciutto panino and the meat was fatty and bread would not hold together, another had cheese ravioli appetizers was greasy, cold, and tasteless_ Also the menu says 6 ravioli and we only received 4_ The salad was nothing special_ I am not sure how Maui has anything to do with the place_ Finally the lunch express is promised in 10 minutes, we waited 20_',)
