("Here's something that doesn't happen every day, especially in what might be considered  a competitive market___ Time: 7:36pm on a Saturday night_ A couple of friends and I decide, _Let's get some wings!_ I have had ATL before from a different location_ The Goldwater store is about 12 minutes away, versus 20+ to the Phoenix location_ So I called to place an order_ A young lady answered, _ATL wings, Please hold__ Three minutes later, nothing_ Wow, we figured, they must be busy_\n\nTried again_ Same response and onto immediate hold_ 6 Minutes later, nothing_ Now, that's a bit ridiculous___ Let's try again_ Same answer, same young woman, followed by the casting forth into hold purgatory_ 13 minutes_ Nothing_ Not even crickets_ This was a telephonic Black Hole from which neither gravity nor light could escape, much less an order of ATL Wings (Hot)_ So now we're just stunned_ I called Long Wongs and placed an order for 50 wings_ Total time: 3 minutes_ Ready in 20_\n\nSo I called back to ATL, (Time: 8:06) asking for the same young woman not to put me on hold AS she answers_ Click___ vooooooiiiiiiiiddddddddddddddd_ And now I am finally just PO'd_ At that moment I determine I will call every 30 seconds until someone actually TAKES the phone call_ Again, _ATL Wings_ Please_____ at exactly the same moment I literally screamed: _WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR MANAGER?_ The answer: _Whaaaat?_ Repeat the question_ Answer: _Nicole__ Is she there this evening? _No__ I then ask the _64,000 question: _Do you realize you have put me on hold multiple times for over 20 minutes?_ And here comes the kicker___ Her answer: _There are only two of us working tonight and we are really very busy_ You can come into the store if you want to place an order__\n\nNo apology_ Just a remarkable mea culpa as can only be offered by someone who flatly could not give a [Fill in the Blank] about me, my order or my money_ I tell her that what she is doing is just NOT the way to conduct business and ask if Nicole will be in Monday_ _She should be__ Well, I'll be talking to her on Monday about this, I say_ Her response: _Whatever__\n\nBy the way, the wings from Long Wongs on Thomas, just west of Scottsdale were fantastic_ And the service was excellent_ And worth every penny of the _50 we spent_",)("Best wings I've had in a while_ Crispy skin, juicy and great seasoning_ Always go 50_50 with ATL and spicy ATL (different, but great heat)_ Staff is always friendly_",)('These wings are great! I am a hot wing lover and their wings really do stand out among the other places I have tried in Scottsdale_ They do make you pay over the phone when ordering to pick up (totally fair!) so do be prepared for that!',)("Probably on my top favorite wings list_ We were in Arizona for the weekend and we stopped by ATL wings twice_ The variety of sauces and the quick service___ amazing_ I've never seen fruit punch served as a soft drink, even better! Crunchy and saucy!",)('This is my first time here, picked this place because of the number of stars_ I was not disappointed_ The wings are amazing and do not pass on the biscuits_',)("I will start off by saying _BEST WINGS_ in town!!!! This is a cute spot in downtown Scottsdale- the atmosphere is great- restaurant is clean and vibrant___ the owner walked us through all the flavor she they offer_ Wings cooked fresh and perfected with their tons of flavors to choose from! We got the Chefs Choice (which is a mild with a kick), Lemmon pepper, garlic parmesan and honey BBQ_ Can't wait to come back and try more flavors",)('Best wings of anywhere_  They have kool aid_ Tuesday they have __75 wings_ Protip: extra crispy_',)("The wings were phenomenal_ Ordered 24-piece bone-in wings with the ATL dry rub, medium, honey BBQ, and honey mustard_ The honey mustard and honey BBQ tasted exactly the same, but again, they were still great_ The ranch and blue cheese that come on the side were also very good and tasted homemade_ Along with our order we had two side salads and at _3_75 a pop, I expect a little more than lettuce and shredded carrots_ Plus, you don't even get celery and carrots with your wings which is____ different_ I also thought 25 minutes for 24 wings and two salads was way too long_ Especially when we were the only ones there, and when the people who came in after us received their order was kind of irritating_",)("This place has some decent wings and is one of the only options for wings in old town! I'm used to getting wings from Wing Stop, but this spot isn't much worse and you don't have to pay extra for ranch! They're about _1_wing, but _0_75_wing on Tuesdays_ The hot and lemon pepper flavors are tasty and pretty safe choices that I like to stick with (plus they're very low on carbs)_ The wings are crispy and flavorful, but they don't include any carrots or celery_\n\nIf you're ordering take out over the phone, you will need to either give them your payment info over the phone or pay at the restaurant and wait a few minutes for them to sauce your wings_ There's plenty of seating if you're dining in, but the workers aren't exactly the friendliest_\n\nThe place is always empty when I come in, but I hope they stay open because I don't want to have to drive across town for wings!",)("Absolutely perfect wings_ The ATL sauce is legit___never had anything like it before_ Oh and don't pass on the honey biscuits so so good_  Wings are my fav food and these are easily top one or two in town_  No question_",)('Just got done eating at ATL Wings and they met all expectations! Food was great, customer service was great, and they have Koolaid machines! Their sauces separate them from the other wing spots though! If you like hot they can definitely give you a good flavor hot sauce or if you just like good flavor they definitely have a wide variety there! I will definitely be coming back to this place! 5 stars from me ATL',)("Amazing service! Corey did an amazing job with the customer service! This was the first time we had ate here and the wings were amazing! This will be our new wing spot! Even though he is a Giants fan__ it's okay! I highly recommend this place to anyone!!",)("Best wings I have ever had_ So glad they came to old town_ Don't let this one slip you by and we have to keep it here_ Dry wings very unique_ Not completely dry but by far best I have had_ ATL spicy has big time kick and will probably go regular ATL next time_ _ Garlic Parmesan awesome_",)("I've never been to another wing spot that offers to let you try their wings sauces or rubs by giving you an actual wing_ Dry rub ATL Style is outstanding_ Lucky's Sweet Red is a close second_",)("Wings are the best I've EVER had_ Dry rub is delicious_ Crispy outside and juicy inside_ I love these wings!! We don't go anywhere else for wings_ We have all our love for ATL wings!!",)('Let me tell you, food is amazing of course but the customer service goes beyond what is expected_ Turned a frown upside down with a simple gesture and has earned a lifetime of recommendations and referrals now_',)("My beautiful wife found this lace for me for valentine's day_ She knows I love wings_\n\nIf you live crispy on the outside and tender meat on the inside and no breading then this is the place for you_ I LOVE THIS PLACE_ I have been 3 times since valentine's day and my order keeps getting bigger each day_ \n\nThe wing like I said above are crispy and meaty_ No bread here for me so perfect for low carb or keto diets_ You pick your sauce and oder the number you want_ Takes about 3-5 minutes to get your oder_ Everything is cooked fresh_ \n\nThe wings have a deep chicken flavor_ I prefer the ATI which is the origional flavor_ Not spicy, just wonderful savory with deep chicken flavor_ \n\nThey use a dry run and then all other sauces if you order them that way_ They have not spicy, spicy, super spicy, honey habenero, lemon peper and many other flavors_ They also have boneless wings_ They also have baked_beans which are reply good_  They are also have Kool aid and Pepsi brand sodas, but no coke which was bummer for_me because I am a coke a cola guy_ For desert they have a fired dough and honey which was dangerously good_ \n\nThis place is so good_ I hate wings where the skin is rubber_ ATL wings are the exact opposite_ \n\nIf you love wings give it a try_ Amazing wings_ \n\nThe owner is a couple from NYC and they are so friendly and kind_ \n\nFoot 5_5_ Service 5_5_",)('So glad this is in Scottsdale! Delicious wings! Lots of meat and cooked perfectly_ The _hot_ sauce was perfectly spiced, not too buttery or watery, and not overly hot_',)
