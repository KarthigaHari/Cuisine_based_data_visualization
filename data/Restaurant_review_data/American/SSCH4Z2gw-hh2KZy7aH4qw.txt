driving down Main St_ in Mesa_ Worth Takeaway is located right next to a light rail stop not too far from the Mesa Arts Center_ The restaurant itself is small and simple and has a nice clean modern feel to it_ They have both indoor seating and a decent size outdoor patio area_ Their menu includes breakfast items, gourmet sandwiches and rotisserie that are made with locally sourced and house-made ingredients_ All their sandwiches run about _9 to _10_ I went right for the Crispy Chicken sandwich_ The chicken itself was pretty crispy and the sauce had a nice blend of sweet and spicy (Sriracha honey mustard) along with their house-made pickles_ The sandwich was absolutely delicious and I loved every bite_ The customer service was outstanding as well_ I enjoyed chatting it up the gentlemen who took my order and he almost sold me on their famous homemade banana pudding I keep hearing about (I was way too full)_ They also sell products from other food producers like Danzeisen Dairy, The Simple Farm, Provision Coffee and Abby Lee Farms_ At the ordering counter they have fresh flowers and t-shirts (and free bottled water!)_ Coming here was a pleasant experience for me and I'll for sure stop in again for that pudding_",)("I should've known better than to doubt Worth_  And not just because Worth fetches hundreds upon hundreds of five star Yelp reviews as of my first visit here_  I've also sampled Worth at the most recent Devour Culinary Festival and really enjoyed the samples they offered_  I'll freely admit some of my skepticism going in was tied to my general disinterest in the Mesa food scene_  Part of me genuinely wondered if Mesa residents who might be unaccustomed to great food in other parts of the valley were driving all those 5 star reviews for this place_  But on a Sunday at lunchtime, I decided to put my doubts aside and make the drive to Downtown Mesa_\n\nWorth is accessible by car or light rail on the north side of Main Street in Downtown Mesa just east of Country Club Drive_  Jim & Kelsey Strothers' place can be easy to miss as its quite tiny_  Seating for 15 max inside and maybe another 20 outside_  Its no wonder then that this is mostly a takeout spot_  The menu is posted above the register and they'll relay the day's specials when you order up front_  I decided to dine in on a relatively quiet Sunday and researched their menu in advance of my arrival_\n\nWorth proudly proclaims their Cuban sandwich as their proudest creation on their Yelp account, so naturally that would be my inaugural sandwich choice_  They also make their own in house potato chips so I grabbed a sack of those_  They also make an in house soda every day (today was a Watermelon & Basil soda) so I got one of those_  And lastly their only dessert option is a house made banana pudding so I ordered that as well_  Total cost for all the house made food, drink, and tax came to about _21_\n\nFor the record, Worth's Cuban sandwich shouldn't be mistaken for a truly traditional Cuban sandwich, but rather Worth's own version of it_  Here the bread is ciabatta (sourced from regional bread maker City Bakery) stuffed with havarti cheese, house made pickles, dijon mustard, mayonnaise, and lots of cured slow roasted pork_  One bite confirmed that Worth has every right to be prideful about this sandwich_  The pork is out of this world and the Ciabatta is a great vehicle for holding it all together_  The house made chips that came alongside had a dash of sea salt, but weren't greasy and cooked to a perfect crunch_  Perhaps the biggest surprise of the meal was the soda_  I don't drink soda and as such was a little uncertain as to whether I would enjoy one house made, but I was very pleasantly surprised_  The watermelon and basil combo gave the soda a slightly tart texture and the soda itself wasn't overly carbonated (in fact I barely noticed the carbonation)_  The banana pudding was a nice cold creamy finisher with big chunks of bananas layered in with heavy cream and breading_  Plus it was served in a small portable portion size for one_\n\nIn addition to their lunch offerings, Worth also has some breakfast items for the morning crowd and a burger for the late afternoon crowd_  Worth also takes great pains to source all of their ingredients and beverages locally and regionally with vendors like Danzeisen Dairy, RAD Juice, Provision Coffee, and Steadfast Farm_  And now they also offer a full catering menu_   So apologies to Worth and their Mesa Yelp fans for doubting you_  It won't happen again_  At Worth the prices are fabulous, the staff are incredibly kind, and the food is outstanding_  Today's lesson?  When you're a restaurant fetching a 5 star average through more than 400 reviews on Yelp, its not a fluke_  Don't question such a Yelp phenomenon as I did_  You'll only be missing out_",)("I will drive a half hour or more out of my way to eat here!!

The restaurant is super cute, and the food was great_ If you like fresh and local ingredients, you have to try Worth :) everyone working was super friendly, you can tell they truly care about you having a good experience_ I love that they always have different sandwiches on special, they do such cool collaborations with other local vendors! \n\nIf you're thirsty, they actually provide water bottles for free, too_ It's crazy how rare that is these days :)",)("Rating this place was pretty hard to be honest__ I almost gave _worth takeaway_ 2_3 stars but I decided to give them 4 and here is why__\n\nI was in the area and decided to try this place out since I notice that it had so many good reviews_ I wasn't sure what to expect from the food or the place do to their prices_ Once I walked in I was greeted by one of their employees and she was definitely friendly, the place definitely had a cozy vibe, the inside is not very big but they spaced it out pretty well, they also have an outdoor seating area which is really cool and both inside and outside were definitely clean_ They do offer you a complementary water with a purchase I believe so that's a plus_ \n\nLooking over the menu I notice that there wasn't a huge selection but The options were definitely there, since it was breakfast when I went in and i really enjoy breakfast and sandwiches I decided to try the Pastrami Croque Madame; now again due to the price(_9_75) I wasn't sure what to expect from the sandwich__ also just to try out at least two of their sandwiches so I could get a better gauge of their food and taste between prices I also ordered the breakfast Sammy which is roughly around _3_50 I believe_\n\nNow to the food__ this is the reason why i was going to give them only 3 stars__ \n\nBoth sandwiches took right about 15+ minutes to come out to the table and I pretty much the only one there_ \n\n1st sandwich up___\nPastrami Croque Madame: it comes with bechamel, pastrami, aged white cheddar, dijonnaise served on sourdough; baked and topped with an over easy egg_ - i was so Excited for this sandwich but it really failed and the sandwich really only looked nice__ the Pastrami was kinda cold and not really cooked which is weird due to the time they took to make it and the bread really did not taste baked and when it comes to sourdough you can really taste the difference____ so it just made the whole sandwich feel undercooked and the whole thing  just ended up having an odd taste to it__ I ended up just eating half of the sandwich___ \n\nNow for the winner of the food and the reason why I could give them back a star is sandwich #2___ \n\nBreakfast Sammy: comes English muffin, aged cheddar, sriracha aioli and a friend egg_ \nIt's super simple and it tasted good the English muffin was toasted on the outside and it had a crisp taste to it on the inside, the aged cheddar and the sriracha aioli mixed amazing with the muffin and egg_ Man I scarfed the whole thing down hahah it's also a surprise due to the cost of this sandwich_ \n\nOver all it was not a super bad experience the employee, cleanliness and the breakfast sammy made up for it_ Hah\nMy stomach was turning a bit after I ate the madame but eh_ \n\nDo I think the place is nice___ yes it's definitely nice_\nI understand the prices are probably high for a reason but if you are playing the Quality versus the quantity factor then you have to make sure that your quality is ALWAYS up there with the taste of the food as well_ I guess going simple on the food is not always a bad thing_ \n\nTHE END__",)('A hidden gem in downtown Mesa_ Great spot for an early morning weekend breakfast_ My wife and I really enjoy the food and especially enjoy the outside dining area and the view of quiet (weekend) downtown Mesa Main Street_ \n\nThe menu seems to be ever changing with specials that keep you wondering what are they going to do next_ Parking and seating is very limited, hence the restaurant name, but worth it_',)("Recently came here to grab a bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised_  I had the roast beef sandwich, my husband had the buffalo chicken and we split some chips_  The flavor was great and I loved the pickled onions and carrots_   The server was helpful and informative and I thought that it was awesome that their water bottles are free_  My only gripe is that it's far too small to sit in and relax if it's even a tiny bit busy_ However, the food really was great so we'll definitely be returning_",)('I had the nitro cold brew which was deliciously frothy!
