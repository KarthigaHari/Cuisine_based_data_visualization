First time here and really enjoyed it! Pleasant staff_ Stephanie was great! Fresh fruit water_ Pictured is watermelon & pineapple_ So amazingly great!! Will be back many times! They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day and have a very large menu option!',)("IHOF_  The acronym just sounds too cheesy, too ripe for mockery, too easily dismissed as a lazy knockoff of IHOP (International House of Pancakes for those living under a rock)_  And indeed if you were to drive by this old and not necessarily attractive looking building on 9th Avenue and Van Buren, you might well expect that your deepest suspicions about this concept would undoubtedly be confirmed_  And yet, with glowing reviews from the Phoenix New Times and lots of early Yelper buzz, it would seem there's more to IHOF's story than it's cover_  Hungry for a hearty breakfast early on a Saturday morning, IHOF's 6am opening time is a rare Downtown Phoenix commodity on the weekend_  So it was off to IHOF for my latest culinary exploration_\n\nWhat the exterior lacks in charm, the comfortable, clean, and pleasantly outfitted interior more than makes up for_  The interior restaurant offers seating for upwards of 50 inside_  There's also  shaded patio seating along Van Buren outside for at least 10 more (a quick note: if you sit outside you'll be hit with the smell of bread consistently due to being located downwind from the local Bimbo bakery right next door)_  The interior includes a beautifully painted mural on the wall and even some fun handmade centerpieces at each table_  I grabbed a seat in the corner and the friendly waitress (didn't catch her name) took care of me this morning_\n\nAs other descriptions of this place suggest, its a wide mix of foods here_  American, Mexican, and Chinese dishes can all be found on the menu_  The breakfast menu specifically is limited to just traditional American and Mexican breakfast fare_  For my breakfast this go around I decided on an American breakfast with a Mexican drink_  My drink was a licuado de platano (or a banana milkshake)_  Came in a GIANT glass and was topped with a healthy chunk of cinnamon on top_  Really awesome drink I must say_  I recommend stirring the cinnamon around a bit to get an even dispersal, but a nice light smooth and refreshing concoction for any time of the day_  For my breakfast itself, I went with the Big Combo_  Two eggs (scrambled with cheese in my case), two bacon, two sausage links, two pancakes, and hash browns_  Simple, straight forward American breakfast_  I was particularly happy with the amount of cheese they gave me with my eggs, and the sausage was tasty too_  Kind of wished the pancakes were a little bigger, but the overall portion was plenty to satisfy me_  Overall, a solid breakfast_\n\nTotal for the breakfast, drink, tax and tip came to about _15_  Good value and good portions and the waitress was very attentive and friendly from the get go_  The breakfast itself didn't knock my socks off, but the licuado was fantastic_  I'd drink that anytime any day_  Across the board, the menu here at IHOF is super affordable with every item being _10 or less_  You can also order large party trays of many of the items they serve on their everyday menu_  So okay, the IHOF name might lack creativity or originality_  But as long as their friendly staff can whip up a tasty inexpensive meal every time I visit, I promise I'll keep the snarky comments to myself_",)('Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out___ Was not disappointed_ The menu is a mix of breakfast, asian, and Mexican foods_ The huaraches with el pastor were great, and I washed it down with a Hawaiian sunrise_ Place is ridiculously clean too_ Will definitely be back!',)("I say four stars and not five because this was only my first time and, well, who knows if I missed something? But thus far, great staff, quiet, simple surroundings, fun selection of things to try, and the food was good_\n\nI had the vegetarian lo mein, for which I thought there'd be a rice noodle option according to the website, but I guess not? Boyfriend had the steak omelette and said it was pretty good_ Fair portions, fair price, and the pineapple water I had while I waited (a very short time) was fantastic_\n\nExcited to go again someday_",)("First time here, I ordered the combo breakfast and a cup off coffee_ Everything was really good, pricing was spot on_ I'll be back!",)("Decent little place for all kind variety of food !

I got onshore which came out as a little ready of sunshine with an umbrella in it_ Didn't miss my coffee at all_ Definitely a great morning stop especially if you are sick of the_ Restaurants that get high ratings because they are trendy (been to way too many disappointments that way) I think the only down side is there really isn't much decor and from the outside it is not eye catching, but that's about it_",)("Wonderful food_ Excellent service_ Haven't had anything I didn't like_ Great place_ Cruz gives great service!!!",)("Per usual, IHOF has made me a delicious plate of Kung Pao chicken extra crispy_  I have been eating here since it opened at the other location and they make delicious tacos, Chinese food and some of the best pancakes_  It's nice that they moved even closer to my work at a state building_  A great option ESP now that's in walking distance_",)('Surprisingly delightful_ Cruz and sylvia were great!
