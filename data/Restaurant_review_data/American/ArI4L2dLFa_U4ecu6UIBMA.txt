("This is a little place behind the Filibertos, but it's BIG on flavor! All the wings are great, but I think my favorite are the ranch! Really crispy and fall off the bone tender_ Don't leave without trying the honey biscuits!! Yum!",)("Can't believe I never wrote a review for this place!\n\nAs you can tell this joint is all about chicken wings_ Freshly made, coming in several different flavors_ We tried the Hot, Ranch, Teriyaki & Honey BBQ___All equally delicious! The owners are great people who create a welcoming feeling to the place_\n\nConsidering the great wings I've tried over the years this by far tops them all_",)("The wings here are incredible_   I'm not sure how they do it, but the wings are so perfectly cooked, so crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, that it puts other wing places to shame_  \n\nTry the _Ranch_ wings for a non-spicy but unbelievably flavorable treat_  Other flavors are also really, really good_ \n\nOn weekends, they do ribs, which quite literally pull right off the bone_  Try those cajun style for a little kick_\n\nWe've gotten take-out from here a few times, and it's always been really good_  The kids love their chicken tenders, and their honey biscuit desserts_  Good stuff_",)("I went again to see Tony and ATL Wings your way, and as usual Tony was there greeting everyone with a smile and a hand shake_ I ordered the 6 piece buffalo wings plus fries and coke combo for _6_99_ I ordered hot wings and they told me there was an x tra hot option which I took_ A few minutes later they came out very hot and spicy_ Wings were crispy and plenty if sauce on there_ The fries were very crispy as well and you also get celery and ranch sauce as well_ As usual the wings were cooked perfectly_ I savored every spicy bite and when I left Tony ( the owner)  thanked me for coming into his restaurant and wished me merry Christmas_ I KNOW I'll be back_ For the price, service and wings this beats his neighbor Buffalo Wild Wings Anyday_",)("Blown away with the customer service provided by Tony (owner)_ Just went yesterday for the first time_ Was greeted and called by my first name after Tony asked for it_ I places my order and went to sit while my order was cooking_ I forgot to tell him that the order I placed was to go so I got up and went to the back of the line so that I can tell him I wanted it to go, he looks at me and calls me by first name and asked me if I had a question, Mind blown! Besides that the wings were awesome, had 10 seasoned Wings which I was told it's their signature and they were bomb! When I first found out of the place I told myself, Are they crazy or what? Opening next to a Buffalo Wild Wings? Well after having ATL wings yesterday now know they are not crazy at all i_m fact they're geniuses!",)("I normally don't bother writing reviews but unlike the previous review that gave a poor rating that ate fish, I ordered WINGS!  Afterall it is a wings joint_ The wings were awesome to say the least_ I like wings with a crunch which is how they serve them_ There's a whole variety of flavors, we got: garlic pepper, ranch, Cajun BBQ & traditional Buffalo mild_ Between the three of us that ate, we couldn't even pick a favorite cuz they were all so good_ Celery sticks were fresh and the service was consistently pleasant & cheerful to every new customer that showed up_ Definitely will be coming back_",)
