("Charlie D's has great catfish!  The portions are really big, and everything is perfectly fried_  There are a variety of sides to choose from_  I am used to eating fries and coleslaw with my catfish, and they were both very good_  I also enjoyed an order of hushpuppies_  My only complaint would be that there is no fountain and only cans of soda_  That is pretty minor though_\n\nCharlie D was very friendly_  There weren't many people in the restaurant when we went in, so Charlie chatted with us for a few minutes about the food, weather, and Arizona_  I will definitely go back the next time I am in the area_",)("GOOD FISH-Was actually going to eat at a sandwich from the spot next to Charlie D's when my husband and I got to talking to one another about the fish if we thought it would be good or what not-We have seen this place a couple of times and always frowned our noses up at the place-Well good thing this time we actually decided to give it a try-AMAZINGLY GOOD-We had the catfish with fries and the red beans and rice-Even though I was not impressed with the red beans and rice my husband loved it_ The homemade hot sauce was REALLY GOOD-The reason for 4 stars is because we haven't tasted anything else on the menu but I am sure it is going to be GOOD as well_",)("Update_  Closed after only a month_  (sigh)\nCharlie D, I think that catfish you served me never worked a day in its life_  How else could it be so juicy and melt in your mouth tender?  You coated it with a crispy breaded shell and served it up with the HOT hot sauce, mmmmm_  I don't know what other magic you've got going in the kitchen but I aim to find out real soon with a plate of chicken and waffles_\nDowntown convention goers, when you get tired of walking around, looking at all the pretty lights and eating at chain restaurants, hop on the light rail going east and hop off at 12th street, the first stop east of downtown_  Cross the street and you are at Charlie D's where you can get yourself some local hospitality and homemade comfort food before going back to your meetings_  Open for lunch and early dinner at present, I noticed they have some lunch specials if you are on a tight schedule_  Just for fun, take a peek at the iconic barbershop in the same building before you depart_",)('Soooo good you need to try the catfish here! Charlie is nice enough to give you a sample with his secret sauce =d not a lot of people were in side_ Next time I will order ahead of time for pick up_',)("It took one bite and I was back where I grew up in the south, deep in Louisiana swamps_ To a world where at 6am you're already knee-deep in muddy ditch water, hunting for crayfish and worms or crawling beneath the house to tease the pups of a stray mama dog- Grannie yellin' from the front door for you to get out from under the damn porch, and Ma in the back yard skinning the catfish ya'll caught before the sun rose this mornin' so she can fry it up for lunch_ \n\nIt's memories like those, brought back after sampling Charlie D's original breaded catfish that remind you that life really was simple once upon a time_  DELICIOUS! Authentic with it's light batter coating and tender meat, and those salt and pepper fries hot out the fryer, I give this place a the best rating possible_ Mostly because this place is right in Metrocenter, competing against commercial giants like Subway and Dairy Queen_ Kudos and thank you for that trip down memory lane!",)("I am here visiting from out of town and after a day of shopping we stopped at the Metro Center Mall Food Court_  I think this restaurant must've recently opened because I didn't notice it when I was visiting last year_  I love catfish and so decided to give it a try_  As I walked up to it,  I first noticed that from a distance it looks nice (nice sign is what attracted me) but as I approached I saw it was very barren looking_  It really didn't look appealing at all_  The girl at the cash register had samples and so I had one and it was good so I ordered a 6 piece catfish meal with a side of onion rings and cole slaw_  I asked about the cole slaw and the girl behind the counter said it was _really good__  I placed my order_  I attempted to pay but there was a problem with the cash register so she went in back to get someone to help her and a young man came out_  He looked like he was the cook_  He punched some keys on they register and showed her what was wrong and then went to the back_  First thing I noticed was that he used the register keys and didn't have gloves on_  Anyway, I paid and she said it would be ready in 10 minutes_  After about 5 minutes I walked up and my order was ready_  First of all, the cole slaw is so sweet_  It is not _really good__  It has too much slaw sauce on it_  Much too sweet_  The onion rings tasted good_  The catfish was really and I mean really deep fried_  It didn't taste exactly like the sample I had tasted at the counter_  I couldn't really taste the catfish, just the deep fried batter_  The red dip that came with it was just extremely hot_  I don't know what it was but it didn't help the flavor of the catfish_  But I was hungry so I ate the catfish_  Here's what really made me angry and caused me to write this review though:  When I was down to the last two pieces of fish I noticed the styrofoam underneath it was eaten away_  I realized that they must've set the very hot fish directly in the styrofoam tray and it had melted the styrofoam and I had eaten it!!!  I just thought how could someone be so unaware that this could happen??\n\nI don't really want this place to close as I think the catfish idea is a good one_  It wouldn't take much to spruce the place up_  Train the employees and make sure they know how to be friendly to the customers_ Teach them customer service_   Get rid of the styrofoam or use paper_  They could have also asked me if I was going to eat there or take it as they could save money on plastic bags by not using them for every order_  People order their food, walk 15 feet away and throw the bag in the garbage_  You need a plastic bag for this?  Lot's of unconscious thinking going on at this place_  If no changes are made, I will really be surprised if they are still in business when I visit Arizona again next year_\n\nPOSTSCRIPT:  A reviewer reminded me that not everyone's food preferences are the same so as to my stating the coleslaw was too sweet, let me say that even though I might have thought it was too sweet, others might not think so and may actually prefer it this way_  So, disregard my statement about the coleslaw_",)
