something ( I can't remember the name, but it was a red curry like dish) and the Chicken Saag_  The Lamb was the winner, but the chicken was also good_\n\nAt dinner, rice and naan are not included, so to get all the pieces of a meal you need to play a little more for ala carte_  But the Garlic Naan was worth it ___ it wafts in your face and ruins other subtle smells, but it's Indian Food, so don't expect many_  Without alcoholic drinks, we had a dinner for 2 for 44 dollars_  And the service was on top of everything ___ They had our water refilled quickly (we went a little too spicy) and our soft drinks topped off as needed_  Really friendly and willing to make sure you had a good experience_",)("I too disagree with Phil G -- a guy who is, apparently, no-frills and quite concerned with money (perhaps 'cheap' comes to mind)_  While I agree it's not your typical very-inexpensive Indian food buffet, I do feel the extra couple of bucks is worth it for:\n\na) consistently fresh, great quality food\nb) a clean_stylish restaurant\nc) an Indian restaurant with a full bar\n\nI've been to India -- and while I'd never claim this makes me any sort of food expert, I will say that while I was there I ate twice at a restaurant named Bukhara -- considered by many to be the greatest Indian restaurant in the world_  So, if nothing else, I have the luck of knowing what the best Indian cuisine tastes like (mind-blowing, by the way)_  I've also recently eaten in an Indian restaurant in Tempe where I found a 2 inch long metal shaving in my food and the food tasted days old_  So, let's say I rank the place in Tempe a 3 out of 10 and I rank the place in Delhi a 10 out of 10_  Guru Palace ranks an 8_  Pretty damned good for Mesa, AZ -- or anywhere else for that matter_\n\nAs for the friendliness____well, maybe they're not trying to be your best buddy from the day they meet you like they do at, for example, TGI Fridays_____but then, um, well_____they're from India -- a place where folks are much more reserved than Americans_  The people at the restaurant are quite pleasant -- calm and polite_  What more do you want from a server?\n\nAnyway, I highly encourage everyone to give Guru Palace a try_  They have an awesome lunch buffet and a great dinner menu, too_",)("Guru Palace is our favorite Indian restaurant, equal to or better than most Indian restaurants in New York City and London_ This advice is from a former New Yorker who grew up in an Indian neighborhood_ And we routinely cook Indian food at home!

The sauces for each dish lacked flavor and spice_ My husband even requested Indian spicy and it wasn't even spicy___it tasted like a mild_ The Garlic Naan was decent_\n\nAt this point we were going to give it a 3___barely! Then the desserts came___\n\nThe gulab jamun was firm and frozen and it seemed like they added extra butter_ghee to the syrup_ The Rass Malai was too thick and creamy, it seemly like it was soaked in heavy cream, which messed up the texture of the paneer_ And after we saw the bill, their score plummeted to 2_ \n\nIt was not worth it_ So many of my classmates have gushed about how great the food is, but I realized, they probably dont know any better_ I grew up near Little India around LA where good Indian food was no hard to find, so I could just be spoiled_",)("I've eaten here several times now and have never had a bad experience_ The food is incredible and with such a large selection of dishes it's the  perfect place to come with a large group_ Some of my favorites: Lamb Vindallo, Chicken Masala, Samosas, Tikka Masala, Mango Lassi, Indian Tea (Chai)_ Oh and who could forget the Garlic Naan - Mmmm! \n\nIt's no wonder Guru Palace is always busy !

lot of people but this is likely due to their location which is located at a strip mall next to Trader Joe's and tucked behind a bank_\nThe food was quite good_  Garlic Naan was hot and flavorful, Roti bread was good_  The rice was excellent but at 3 to 4 dollars a bowlful quite expensive a la carte_  Chicken Tikki Masala was very good_  Lamb was done very well_  All sauces were done excellently and had wonderful flavor_  Having eaten at other Indian places in Boston, Santa Monica, and Fremont Ca (the Bombay Palace)_  I've had very authentic Indian food and this place rates highly_  \nThe cons are that being Indian food tends be be labor intensive, the prices are quite high_  \nService was attentive and excellent_  Decor was subdued and lighting was low and intimate_

like some more naan but we never got any_ I know the owners of this restaurant_ The food servers do not get to keep tips_ The tips are rung up and put in the cash register, and the servers are simply

he also wrote that we didn't get the other half of our food along with a 0_ for a tip_ Then we left_\n\nIndian oven is much better because you can self serve what you want to eat for your dinner but if you prefer to have it served to you from the menu -

I have been going to Guru Palace for years now_ Before I started visiting this location I frequented another one of their restaurants (Indian Dehli Palace)_ Today, is the last day I will ever return to either_ I usually purchase takeout and spend about 50 dollars each trip_ I ordered takeout around 1pm which I usually order at night, and when I got home and tried everything___the food tasted unusually bland_ The palak paneer was runny and I noticed it upon opening the container_ I got a spice level of 7 which was probably a 3_ The garlic nann which I the easiest thing to prep on the menu was old and lacked flavor_ Even the hostess looked at the bread once and agreed that it was bad_ I drove back all the way from McClintock and Broadway area to the restaurant to return the food_ I was offered credits and discounts however I know from experience that sending food back and having them re-make it (especially when the wait staff was questing me so much) can potentially result in the chef or chefs _messing with your food__ That may be my own personal worry but at this point I had lost my appetite and was seeking a credit since I honestly did not want to return to this location_ It honestly felt like I was being interrogated the entire time I was there_ I was told over the phone that the manager would be there in 15 minutes and when I finally arrived there about 40 minutes later I was still waiting (15 minutes) for the manager (the owners daughter) to arrive_ Once she arrived I had to re-explain everything_ I stated that the only thing that was cooked correctly was the dahl and the rice_ I told her that I have never complained in the entire 10 plus years that I have visited their restaurants_ I understand that sometimes a restaurant is going to have a bad day___it happens_ So she calls the chef whom is outside on a break and since she spoke in Indian, I couldn't understand anything she was relaying to him_ She got off the phone and proceeded to offer me a gift card when I told her from the get go that I simply wanted a refund_ She told me that since I admitted that the dahl was cooked correctly along with the rice that I should pay for it_ I said absolutely not_ She continued to say that she spoke with the chef and he said he cooked everything correctly and that I was wrong_ I was dumbfounded! Are you kidding me? She said no, this chef has been here for 20 years and he cooks everything correctly_ At this point I was heavily offended because one I was being questioned (I'm the fucking customer!) and two she proceeds to walk back toward the register bitching that I didn't have any money which is why I am returning it_ She told me she couldn't reuse any of the food because I had put some of the rice and dahl back into the containers (I RETURNED EVERYTHING IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING) I told her I would hope she wouldn't reuse anything that anyone returns, as it is against health codes_ Are you kidding me??????????
