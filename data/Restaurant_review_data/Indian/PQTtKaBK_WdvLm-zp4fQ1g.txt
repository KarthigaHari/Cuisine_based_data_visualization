("wow! if you're looking for a third world dining experience,  look no further_  This has to be the most dysfunctional restaurant crew I've ever come across_ It's a Thursday night at 8, there's only 3 tables  of customers, I placed a single take out order_ After an hour of waiting, the lady  who took the order came over not with a glass of water and an apology but with a bogus excuse of how the printer wasn't working and that's why the order was taking so long_ How do I know the excuse was bogus? because she phoned the last guy who picked up his take out order to come back because she had put my order (which had taken forever to prepare due to a broken printer) in with his order_ My food had been gone from the restaurant  for 15 minutes with some strange guy_ When he brings it back she puts it in a bag and charges me full price_ No discount, no free coke, nothing but just wonder about what the strange man could have done to my dish_ Horrible service, you can hear the kitchen staff yelling and laughing all the way into the dining room_ the food is mediocre,  there are better south Indian restaurants in town with better service_ Folks_____leave the third world, don't give a crap attitude back in India_ You were ruled by the British for a long time, I'm sure somewhere along the line they taught you about order, let's try to get it together_",)("The best Indian food I've ever had_ Staff was a little passive which is why I gave 4 out of 5_ But, this place is definitely worth trying_",)('We ordered a second order of garlic naan bread so we could soak up every last drop of the chicken tikka Marsala  and the lamb saag sauce___ This is the best Indian food we have ever had and we love love love Indian food_ Service is wonderful as well!! Very attentive!!!',)('Have to say this is the best Indian food we have had in Arizona_ Service was incredible with a waiter who shared information on different dishes and their ingredients as well as a history of the foods_ It is rare that you can eat out and have better food than home cooked! Prices were good considering the excellent quality of ingredients_ So worth the visit____ask for James, he is amazing_',)('Various delicious dishes for the buffet __ I go to indian buffets often and I have to say Aachi has more choices and better dishes than most',)("It's the bomb_ Forward and direct bold flavors_ Authentic and unique_ Spice is perfect_ Clean food_ Not greasy_ If you order all vegetarian you won't miss the meat_",)("Tried this place today just on a whim passing by_  I'm not that much of an Indian food fan but thought I'd try something different_  And, I was quite impressed_  I won't necessarily go back here on every visit to Phoenix, but will go back again at sometime_\n\nMy only gripe___they cut the chicken into chunks after cooking_  This makes it difficult to eat without getting chunks of bone in your mouth and having to spit out_  Perhaps this is the traditional way though___  It was at least tasty!",)('Very Good food_ Perfect South Indian food_ Worth for the price in case of buffet_',)("The place was packed which is usually a good sign_ I walk back to use the restroom and observe the kitchen staff in tank tops_ Uh oh_ Then I proceed to the buffet_ Limited selection but I dive in anyway_  Head back to my table and one dish is cold_ The other is luke warm_ No one comes by my table for a good 10 minutes to check in_  This is not a professional restaurant owner_ Must be a rookie_ I won't be back_",)('We went to this restaurant for dinner after a long day in a hope to get some delicious South Indian food_ Little did we know that this is going to be the worst dinner ever_ My husband ordered some Indo Chinese food and the food was nowhere close to be called as Indo  Chinese_ The Chicken Manchurian was so undercooked and sweet that he had to add some red peppers chutney to it to make it barely edible_ The eggplant curry that I had ordered for myself was equally disliked by us as let alone the bad flavor, the eggplants were so undercooked that they were almost raw_ Had hard time cutting an eggplant into small piece_ I guess chicken would have been much easier to cut_ Just wanted to give this new restaurant a try but was the biggest mistake_ We all had stomach ache all night after eating such undercooked, flavorless food_ Never going back_',)("This is our first South Indian buffet meal, although we've consumed many of the Northern variety_ The food was extremely tasty with wonderful spice levels_ The chicken biriyani, chicken tikka masala and vindaloo were especially good_ The servers were attentive and quickly removed used plates_ Several varieties of chutneys and sauces -- all good_ Well maintained facility with excellent cleanliness_ Recommended!",)('Aachi used to be awesome_ For a while I thought Chandler _Tempe finally got  a decent south Indian restaurant_ Recently there has been a change in management_ The service is late now, food is terrible_ Will be following the old management',)('Food option in lunch buffet was awesome_ Chicken suka masala with dosa and idli combination is super__',)("hidden away in a quiet section of Eliot I found this place_ at lunch they have a buffet with  a great selection of food from South India_  it  was  the perfect combination of healthy and tasty cooking_  a little spice but nothing to go  crying about_ the  service was nice, very pleasant and didn't get in your way of eating_  overall I fully  enjoyed this place_",)('Been wanting to try this place since it showed up on my yelp!

The flavors here are bright, vibrant and yes spicy_ Like many new Indian places they start out with great flavor, people complain and after a year or two they start serving the same mild mush as everywhere else_ So please if you love good flavors and spice go here, otherwise find somewhere else_\n\nThis place as the name suggest has south Indian food, Which for me means Dosa's and a few new to me menu items_\n\nWe had a Dosa filled with a spicy gobi (cauliflower), it was delicious and yes spicy_ My one gripe is that for the soup and chutneys they just filled up some small bowls from the buffet line that was set out for lunch_\n\nWe also had an eggplant  curry dish that had a _tangy tamarind and peanut sauce_ It was good but I could not taste the peanut_\n\nAs for the ambiance it is decent, not much different from the last Indian place that was here_ Tables Booths cloth napkins and ~ _10+- per dish for dinner and lunch is the obligatory buffet_",)("Best Indian food I've ever had!
