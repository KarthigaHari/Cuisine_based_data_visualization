My husband and I both chose platters for lunch and I had shrimp and he chicken_ Everything in plate was good but The Marsala was DIVINE, we both agreed_ I will definitely be a repeat customer wanting to try the rest of the menu_",)("MY FAV INDIAN in AZ!!!! Can't say enough about this place_____ it is just spot on___ The servers & chefs are SUPER attentive & helpful as well____ I'm in love with so many of their dishes I could eat there EVERY DAY ____ Seared Tofu _ Samosa Chaat _ Idly _ Masala Dosa _ Chickpea Ceviche _ Lentil Soup _ Channa _ Aloo Gobi _ Goan Curry _ Paneer anything _ Tikka etc etc ___ HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! They are also expanding into the spot next door and creating a bar area ____",)('Loved the food_ The Bel was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala had a great mix of spices_ Definitely try the mango Bellini!',)("If you want great Indian food then this is the place for you!  This is by far the BEST Indian food in Scottsdale_Phoenix_\n It was so much fun to try different dishes and have everyone taste GREAT_  Yes, everyone was delicious_\n I couldn't pick a favorite because they were are ALL fantastic_   When we left the restaurant we were already planning our next trip back_",)('We had a wonderful dinner tonight_  Delicious food including chicken curry and lamb vindaloo_  Spice level was medium plus_  The service was so attentive and sincere_  Abraham and Gina were great_  We look forward to our next visit!',)("So nice to see the old (Tatum & Shea) Bombay spice concept back_ Granted I did not give the Cactus Rd_ buffet a shot thanks to Yelp Reviews, I did want to see what Marigold Maison was about_ Great ambiance and open kitchen, Sunil the head chef is always welcoming_ Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening_ My kids now say let's go eat at _Andy's Place_, not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made_ And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge_ Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever_ I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore___\n\nA side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their _dinner was good but they miss the buffet__ Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla___I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it_ It's no fraud! You can quickly figure out which reviews are _fraudulent_ and which are not, so I'm glad to see Bombay_Marigold Maison is in touch with reality and Yelp's value add to restaurant owners_ Ok off my soapbox_ Go to Marigold Maison and tell them a Yelper sent you!",)("Wow_ This place_ First time we went the chef was trying out dishes and we had a few plates come out for us to test_ They were all great_ We also had a seafood special that was to die for_ \n\nWe've been back many times and it hasn't disappointed_",)('My husband and I took my brother out for his birthday for some Indian food_ This was our first time to this place_ Our waitress Pulpa was phenomenal_ She was very attentive, funny and personable_ She truly made our dinner spectacular_ The food was delicious also_ And they have happy hour and a decent wine list for an Indian place_ Definitely coming back_',)("This was my first time here_  I went with a large group, and I had an opportunity to try about 5 different dishes along with several different appetizers_  Let's start with the positive - the tandoori salmon was heavenly_  The naan was hot, crispy, and flavorful_ Everything else was truly disappointing_  The dishes either totally lack flavor, or they were just all heat and no substance_  My review is on the flavor of the food, not the heat level_  For me, the heat level on most of the dishes was inadequate_   For the dishes where the heat levels were adequate, they substituted heat for flavor_ \n\nI have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants; I usually eat Indian food about 8 to 12 times a year_  I absolutely love Indian cuisine in general, but not here_  The servers were attentive and very pleasant; I have no problem with the wait staff_  The ambience is very nice too_  This review is on the food alone_  When I look at the other reviews, my guess is that the patrons who frequent this restaurant have not been to many other Indian food destinations_  I can think of about three locations within 15 minutes of this restaurant where the food quality is another league_\n\nI could give you a list of about a dozen other Indian restaurants in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area that blow this place out of the water_  With so much awesome Indian food in the valley, I would say that you could skip this restaurant, and you wouldn't be missing anything_  I actually don't give many bad reviews, and I would give it 2 1_2 stars if possible_  I figured I would round up to 3, just to be nice_  Everything about the restaurant is perfectly fine, except the food is average at best_  The portions were substantial and the prices were reasonable; the food was just completely unimpressive_  I won't be back, but I actually can't wait to return to one of my old standbys because I didn't realize how good they were until I had a chance to compare them to this restaurant_",)("I learned about this place when they offered a _lunch only_ Groupon_  When I looked them up I realized they were located at the same address Bombay Spice had recently relocated to in 2014, which means Bombay didn't even last a year_  I went there for lunch yesterday_  Both the waiter and General Manager were very nice and answered several questions_  \n\nI learned that Marigold is owned by the same corporation (JNK Concepts) that owned Bombay_  They have the same chef, but completely different food, menu and pricing_  JNK has multiple restaurants primarily in Phoenix and Chicago_  They also own Roka Akor and Nobuo here in the Phoenix area and still have one Bombay Spice in downtown Chicago_\n\nThe restaurant has been upgraded slightly_  You no longer order your food at the counter; they have wait staff_  The prices are considerably higher_\n\nI told both the waiter and GM that I'd not been there before and wanted to be impressed, so asked them what they would suggest, indicating that I was thinking of ordering one of their Thali dishes_  They recommended that I try one of two other dishes which weren't on the lunch menu, but their dinner menu_  I seldom order Dosa because they are usually vegetarian, which I'm not, but I decided to give it a try_  In addition, I specifically wanted to taste their Naan_\n\nThere Dosa is called _Masala Dosa_ which is a crepe filled with potato and onion_  It is served with two sides; Coconut Chutney (the larger bowl) and Sambar_  The crepe looked massive on the plate when it was served, however half of it was filled - the rest was just empty crepe_  The Coconut Chutney was very good, but I wished it had been spicier and there had been more of it_  The filling was OK, but not terrific, however you have to keep in mind, I'm not a vegetarian_  There was very little spice, and in my opinion, taste, in the filling_  There Naan bread was very good, but not the best I've had at some nearby Indian restaurants_\n\nTheir service was excellent and the GM was very helpful_  I left with mixed emotions_  The food was good, but I was not as blown away as others appear to be_  I'm sure they use good ingredients and it was well prepared, but to me lacked the kick and taste I would have preferred_  The killer was their prices; considerably higher than most Indian restaurants_  \n\nThis Dosa and Naan came to _14_  I'm not a big eater, but the Dosa without the Naan would not have filled me_  Without a coupon I wouldn't go back and pay _14 for what I had_  It probably isn't fair to compare their prices with other places because they claim their meat and fish are a far better quality, and I haven't tried them, but I frequently get either a meat or seafood masala_curry, and Marigold's prices are 25-70% more_  Without additional coupons it is unlikely I'd return, based on price alone_  Their food to me wasn't _that_ special_\n\nI'm giving them a 3-star overall, but believe their food probably deserves a 4-star, although not for me based on what I had_",)("I'm really not sure how this restaurant has received such high reviews_  I've been to many Indian restaurants in the US & in the world (including in India) and this is the most overrated place I have been to_  The food was very average_  Seems like a place people go to for the atmosphere_  I really don't understand the high ratings here_  I recommend Nandini and Little India in Tempe_",)("We've visited twice_ First time around tried the Biryani Hyderabadi and Special roasted Salmon_ Biryani was a lot spicier than i expected, but the cardamom_cumin crusted Salmon was delicious _ \n\nSecond time was even better_ Lamb curry and Chicken tikka (tandoor) were both excellent - the meat was cooked exactly right and the spices were flavorful, but not overpowering at all_ Service was great both times_",)("It was pretty busy for a late lunch on a Monday_ I absolutely loved the food - when I heard same ownership as Roka, I knew we had to check it out, as Roka was always a favorite of mine when I lived I'm AZ_ Don't expect anything like Roka though! This is a totally different concept, in the side of a strip mall, and much more casual_\n\nI went with my bf and his family, we tried just about everything we could from a couple of the street food options to the lunch platter with chicken tikka and another chicken with a spinach curry (thali's?)_  The chickpea dip with potatoes was super good and unique, the sauteed rice with vegetables and curry was fantastic as was the garlic naan_  I loved the quinoa salad on the lunch platter, it was a lot of food and fun to share between four of us_ The chickpea flour battered chicken was a good option for very picky kids - although we loved the spicier options! \n\nOur server was good about describing the preparations and we asked him to ask the chef to order for us (a good way to get to try the best items I think)_ We ended up with four dishes that I had never had before and I loved them all!  If I were local, I would def make it a fun lunch or date night spot_",)('Good food, decently fast service_  Big selection, the lunch specials are well worth it and you get a great selection_',)("I was really hankering for some Indian food_ The reviews of this place were great, the people on the phone were awesome and the service was super_ We got our food for our takeout order_ It smelled great and the first few bites were incredible_ The samosa was delicious_ But the rest of the food was so salty I could barely taste anything else_ They even salted the salad_ The salad! Seriously? What's the point of that? I wanted so badly to love this place_ I wanted to this to be our go to Indian place_ Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen_ Why is it that restaurants have to over salt their food like that? After spending over _50 for dinner I was exceptionally disappointed and had to throw out over half the food_",)("After living in England, I grew accustomed to really good Indian food_ I've been searching for a proper curry in the Phoenix area for the last few years_ This is the first place that's hit the spot_ \n\nWe came in for dinner and ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chicken korma_ The chicken tikka masala had a bit more of a tomato base than I am used to but it was delicious_ The korma had a little kick to it but I wouldn't really register it as spice_ Overall, the flavor of everything was amazing_ We also had a garlic naan and papadums_ Everything tasted wonderful and the service was good_ We will definitely be bringing all of our family and friends here_",)("Got take out chicken tikka masala, sagg paneer, lamb vindaloo, lamb biriani, and garlic nann_  I've tried a lot of Indian food throughout the valley and this was the best I've had_  The flavors were very clean, and judging from what I saw and smelled when I walked in, the chefs that cooked this meal really know their stuff!
