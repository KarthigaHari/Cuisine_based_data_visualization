A must try!!',)("My first time here_ I ordered take out and gladly so_ It was a bit awkward when I walked in because no one was behind the register- no employees to be found_ I starred at the ice cream options for a good 5 minutes before someone came out to give me my food_ \n\nI am impressed by the price and food itself reminds me of Indian street food! I can't wait to come back and try some of the ice cream :) but during this first visit I got the chicken biryani and chicken 65_ Both were good, I liked the chicken 65 more, the flavor was great! The biryani was a bit dry - hard to say how old it was but you can tell when food is over a day old ;) \nI'll be back to try other options_ I'll definitely be getting the chicken 65 again, I'm not sure why it's called that but to me they were like boneless Indian chicken wing?

Excellent place to stop and pick up dinner! I like that they change the menu seasonally and the mango lasse is delicious!',)("This review only applies to the ice cream_ We stopped in one night_ The woman working was very friendly and let us try the flavors we weren't familial with--they have both Indian and the _standard_ US flavors_ We settled on a scoop of chai and a scoop of chocolate chip_ The chocolate chip tasted a bit freezer burned, chalky, and was full of ice crystals_ The _2 carton of Kroger brand is better than this_ The chai was better_ Richer, creamier, but there were still ice crystals_ The food has great reviews and I'm tempted to try it but the ice cream was really disappointing_",)("Curry & Scoop___ I don't even know how to say everything I feel about this place, it is SO delicious!! Friends and I came here on a whim because we were intrigued by its name, and I'm so glad we did -this has to be my new favorite Indian restaurant of all time - The portions are ridiculously large, the seasonings are perfect, it is fast and affordable, and the bearded worker who helped us, was so knowledgeable and friendly!  \n\nI got the chicken biryani and samosas for dinner, and ended up saving more than half because I was full! It was a little spicy for me, but definitely a good kind of burn haha\n\nI also sampled every ice cream flavor, and if you even only kind of like sweets, you must come here!!
