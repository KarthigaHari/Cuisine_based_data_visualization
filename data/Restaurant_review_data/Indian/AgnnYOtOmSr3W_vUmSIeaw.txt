('Looking for an Indian buffet for Sunday lunch we settled on the newly opened Mirchi Indian Cuisine_ We both had the lunch buffet for _9_95_ The food was fresh, delicious and  superbly seasoned_ Homemade relishes and chutneys rounded out to the meal_ The owners are very friendly and pointed out  GF  and vegetarian options_ Pretty much everything is GF_ We will be back!',)("This place took over the old Bay Leaf indian restaurant so we gave it a try last night with new management and first of all I never expect good customer service at indian restaurants but these guys have excellent service! Extremely friendly!!\nSecond the food, we moved here from Chicago and so far nothing had met our expectations on taste, we were always disappointed but this place has changed that! The food was so amazing that my picky kids were licking their fingers and finished everything on their plate! The chicken 65 Biryani was amazing___chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken all excellent!! You even get free tea after you are done :)   Sooo happy I found this place!! I just hope they don't change their taste because once a restaurant becomes famous they start cutting corners and change their menus___keep doing what you guys do cuz we love your food!",)("Had eaten at old Bay Leaf Cafe several times and enjoyed it very much_ Returned today to find new owner_ My wife and I had the lunch Buffet_ We enjoyed it very much and you can't beat the price_ Very friendly staff_",)("Good indian food! Have already been to this establishment 3 times since they've opened last month_ Definitely check it out_ Also wanted to add, they have five levels of spiciness I believe and the mildest level wasn't too hot which was perfect for me_",)('Ate sad lunch buffet for NINE DOLLARS!!!!!  Dried out biryani, drier tandoori, dry and tasteless butter chicken, ok chai, barely warm veg korma_  After I made the mistake of commenting on temperature and quality of food got chewed out for showing up at 1pm_  Why did I expect quality food at that hour?  Well, because you are open for business, because the food was out, because you dared brag about all your other restaurants_  _9!!!!  No signs showing price, guess I should have asked_  Pitiful_  Those positive reviews must have been left by owners_',)
