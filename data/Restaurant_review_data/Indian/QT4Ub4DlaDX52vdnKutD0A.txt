The food is reasonably priced and very tasty_ Their take on palak paneer is one of the better ones I've had_ The staff is very friendly and really go above and beyond to make sure you are happy_",)("This restaurant is amazing! I had the chicken tikka masala and couldn't believe the price and size, not to mention the taste!!!! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality, authentic Indian food_\n\nHowever, we came back again to pick up our order and they doubled the bill from 31 to 63_  We had to kind of find a deal because they said they couldn't give us cash because they didn't have any___? So instead we have a gift card there for thirty dollars in which the cashier signed and wrote _over paid them__  I do not know if we will get the thirty dollars back because we have not been ever since they charged us way over_\n\nThe food is amazing but the fact they sneakily doubled our check is not_",)("They had the option of a buffet for people like me who didn't know what I wanted_ Got a spoonful of everything on my plate_ It was so delicious!",)("After my family finished watching a lovely holiday performance by Tetra string quartet, we meant to eat out at ph_ After leaving the concert, it was too late for ph_ So we went here instead_ At first, we were a little hesitant about it, (it is kind of a dive_) \n\nQUANTITY\nMy father wanted the buffet, but the rest of my family ordered off of the menu_ One of the workers told my dad that they were actually closing the buffet, so he would just have the cook make different foods from the buffet_ Holy cow, he brought him enough food to feed my entire family!
