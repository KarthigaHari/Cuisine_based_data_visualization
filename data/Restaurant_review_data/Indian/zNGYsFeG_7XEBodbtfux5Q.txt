My friend and I decided to share an order of the lamb shank, sabzi (spinach) and badanjan (eggplant)_ When it came out it was more than enough for 2 people (more like 3+ people)_ The lamb shank was a decent portion topped on a bed of fluffy basmati rice that had shredded carrots and raisins with a side of cucumber salad_ The lamb was moist and flavorful_ The sabzi was nice and creamy with just the right amount of spices and the badanjan  was cooked until it was soft with just a little kick to the taste_ The entree came with a plentiful helping of  naan as well_ We had to box most if it to go since there was so much food_ I also ordered a mango lassi, it was good but I've had better_ I think I'll get the Chai next time since my friend said it was really good_",)('This is one place that i have been visiting last 2_5 years and here is my feedback\n1_taste remains consistent forever_\n2_Respectful cook\n3_Wonderful Baklava for 0_99\n4_Facility is clean \n5_ Location and ambience is ok____ but the food taste compromises for good reasons_\n\nHighly recommend_ \n\nOnly recommendation to the management is to \n1_ Extend hours of business is required_ You do not let customers to dine in after 8 PM____though you are open until 9 PM____ I have driven a couple of times so far thinking you close at 9 but you refused to dine in____ ended up little frustrated____ I am sure am not the only one who wod have experienced this_____',)('The food was ok_ I ordered the chicken boti and lamb skewers for my husband_ The food was good, and plenty of it, but not flavor city_ Unfortunately for the us the food did not live up to the hype_ The samosas were the BEST part of the meal_',)("This place is down the street from my work, so we stopped here for dinner one evening after work_ There's an Afghan restaurant close to my house I really liked so I was trying to see if this place could top them_ \n\nWe ordered the mixed grill platter (_24_99) with a mixture of several kabobs to try_ It came with chicken, beef, and lamb_ I really enjoyed the chicken_ It was moist and flavorful_ The beef and lamb were okay, nothing remarkable_ The platter came with rice, salad (similar to pico de gallo) and yogurt sauce_ \n\nThe platter was huge, enough food for 3-4 people, so we definitely had leftovers to take home_ At _24_99, it was a great value for what you get_ I would visit again but it is not something I would drive out of my way for_",)('We loved the food and a quick and polite service at the Khyber Halal, definitely will be back!!!',)('Unique, disticnt and literly colorful flavors can be found here at quite reasonable prices_\n\nThere are several veg options here including the Gulpi_ Coliflour with a tumeric and other spices sauce which was just beyond wonderful_ It left my foung dancing and my fingers yellow from all of the flavor_ It is serverd with their _naan_ bread which is much more like a thick tandoor bread_\n\nThis was just a quick take out order and I am excited to try everything they have to offer_',)("I just ate there for the first time and I must say it was amazing!  The food is fresh and I can't wait to go back and try something new on the menu_  I had a mango yogurt drink and started with one beef samosa and one veggie samosa, both were wonderful, then we each had an entre and both entres were amazing and big enough to share or take home_  I just finished my left overs from eating there last night_  The atmosphere was casual and comfortable_  I would feel comfortable eating there by myself or with a friend_  I will definitely be back and my boyfriend has been talking about the food since we left there last night_",)("This is our household's very favorite restaurant_ It's a little out of the way for us, but we always have an incredible meal with leftovers for days and days_ \n\nPortions are fairly gigantic and quite reasonably priced - especially delicious baklava for _1, which I've _never_ seen cheaper_ In particular, the lamb kebob, the mantoo, and the gyros are favorites_\n\nThe woman who always waits on us works really hard, and she's always so nice_ We were just there for a birthday, and she noticed that I didn't order anything besides a soda_ I explained to her that I was quite broke, and she surprised me by bringing me a gyro on the house, which she remembered me getting last time and loving_ This was more than a month ago! I nearly cried_ \n\nThat being said, don't go in and try and get a free meal! It was just a really cool thing that she didn't have to do_\n\nAnyway, this is the best Afghani_Pakistani food around_ The only thing that could make it better would be to pick it up and put it right next to our apartment - but it's worth the drive_",)("The food here is amazing_  I've loved everything I've gotten here_  Just tried the lamb kabab and it was amazing!
