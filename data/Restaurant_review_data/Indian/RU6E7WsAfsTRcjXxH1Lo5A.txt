But I will say, it was a tasty dish! I don't think white meat chicken is used for that one either___as others have said, portions are kinda on the small side_ It automatically comes with a salad, so if you don't want it, you bowl is only half filled with rice___that may disappoint some people_ I was full when I left though_ I spent around 11 dollars for a 2 meat entree and a medium drink_ All in all it was a decent meal if you're looking for fast food Indian_",)('Food was great and service was great_ It was my first time here and they let me and my friend try as much as I wanted before I selected_ Food was fresh, had great flavor, and satisfied my craving for Indian cuisine_ The naan bread was out of this world good_ They baked it right in front of us and served it to us fresh_ Their _8 2 entree meal was a deal!',)('Very friendly_ Tasty food_ Nice location next to the movies and shopping_ Will be back on another movie night_',)("This place satisfies my need for curry!
