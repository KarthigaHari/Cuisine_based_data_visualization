It's a mild vegetarian dish, but it is warm and comforting_ The cauliflower dumplings are in a subtly spiced yogurt gravy, and the best way I can describe it is like India's version of an alfredo sauce with cauliflower_ I highly recommend it, it's so good!\n\nSamosas-  Great vegetable samosas! The filling is balanced with the holy trinity of Indian spices like curry, cumin, and coriander_ There are even bits of cilantro in it as well_ You can never go wrong to order these as a snack or to add to your meal_\n\nBest garlic Naan too, perfect texture and fresh! \n\nLast but not least, THE BEST EVER!!!\nFresh Pickled Lemon_ Lemon Chutney- This deserves a mention_ I've been told these lemons are fresh from the family lemon tree, it's a family recipe_ Grandpa Singh won't teach me how to make my own, so I have to come here and ask them for large containers of it or bring a jar because they are the BEST and no other Indian restaurant has this, so it's a rare treasure_ LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! Best lemon chutney you will ever find in Arizona! \n\nIn conclusion, I love this place! I love the people! I've tried a few other Indian restaurants and most of them don't even compare_ There are plenty of other items to choose from on the menu_ This place never disappoints me and it deserves a higher rating!",)("I've been looking for a decent Indian option in Central Phoenix, and this place seemed to be getting the best reviews_\n\nThe good?  The naan was at the table when we were ready to eat, which is nice_  The service really was pretty decent here_  They had veggie samosas, and a couple of different daal dishes_  The paneer tikka or whatever it was called was good, and something I don't typically see on Indian buffets_\n\nUnfortunately, the curries seemed a little too soupy for my taste, and there were only two options (Curry Chicken and Butter Chicken, booooooring)_\n\nI guess I'm now spoiled after so many excellent trips to Kabab Palace in Tempe_  Oh well, I guess I still don't have a good Indian option for Central Phoenix_  At least the price was reasonable_",)("Do not go here!  I can't tell you whether the food is good or not because I didn't even get that far_ My boyfriend and I love Indian food and we were excited to try a new place_  The grocery store is situated in the front, with the restaurant in the back_  Upon entering,  I noticed the man at the register was CLIPPING HIS FINGERNAILS!!! This obviously made me concerned about the cleanliness of the establishment_  I quietly turned to my boyfriend and asked if he thought it was a good idea to eat there, but he said, _it's okay, let's just try it__  So I continued to the dining area and took a seat_  A lady came and asked if we wanted the buffet,  but we said no, and asked if we could see a menu_  She then looked at us like we were seriously inconveniencing her, and reluctantly went to get a menu, then started talking to the man who was clipping his nails_  At that point, we just got up and left_  DIRTY AND RUDE!",)("Not fancy nor do they have an extensive selection_ In fact they are just a few chairs and tables in the back of an Indian market_ But what they make they make well_ I specially like their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala_  Their tandoori chicken is served on a bed of onions and is not as interesting_ As well he just doesn't stay warm_ They serve absolutely delicious gulabjamoon (a syrupy doughball dessert) and have a decent Indian chai_  Hot Naan is included",)("I really enjoy this place_ With a new addition to my family, my wife and I are looking for less formal and less expensive places to eat_ We started eating here because the Phoenix Community Acupuncture was across the parking lot_ We really feel as if we've found a gem in our part of town_ \n\nInformal, connected to a store and there are places where Baliwood videos could be turned down___but well worth it_ \n\nWe have gone for the buffet each time we have gone_ The price is very reasonable and they don't mind that our one year old picks off of our plates_ Everything is good, but the Tika Masala was very tender and delicious_",)("Well this was an odd experience_ \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for a while_ We finally made it there for a Friday dinner_ Upon entering, the man made a gesture towards the restaurant_ We walked in but must have still looked confused because he told us to sit wherever we'd like_ \n\nI was pretty excited_ It smelled great and we were both very hungry_ We took a seat and waited for the service_ It never came_ After about ten minutes, I walked to the front and grabbed two to-go menus_ There was a lady behind the counter but she never acknowledged us_ We figured the to-go menu was pretty similar to the real menu so we took 5 or 10 minutes looking it over and deciding what we would like_ Still, no one had acknowledged us at our table_ \n\nAfter a while another couple had walked in, been given a menu and waters_ My girlfriend suggested we leave but I wanted to wait around_ I was more curious than anything_ The one waitress took other orders, refilled drinks, brought out food, but we just sat there_ Completely ignored_ \n\nThe waitress never came and my hunger got the better of my patience_ After about a half hour, we left_ I tried to make eye contact with any employee but they all looked away_ \n\nWe left the restaurant laughing at the weirdest dining event we have had in a while_ \n\nI guess we won't be going back?",)('Loved it_ Grocery_small restaurant____ 7_99 for the non veggie combo plate_ It was great portion_ Food taste great_ I will definetly be back!',)("I absolutely love Indian food and happened to be talking to some neighbors about their favorite place in the Phoenix area, which led me to New India Bazaar_  This place certainly doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food was quite tasty_  I stopped in and ordered food to go and it took about 20 minutes - not too bad of a wait_  I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and a mango lassi and my husband enjoyed his biryani___all so tasty!  We'll definitely be back next time we're craving some amazing Indian food!",)("Was disappointed to find that the buffet was discontinued_ Would come here at least once a month_ Restaurant was empty_ Can't see them staying in business much longer with the current concept_",)('Chatt, Tea and Pizza three of the surprised I found on my last trip_ \n\nMost buffets have the usual suspects garnished with rice naan and some condiments_ But to have a Chatt available?  Chai Tea (included) and even pizza (yes Indian style veggie pizza and its good)\n\nThis is why I am so in love with this place, 1 Great Flavor, you can beat the unmuted flavors that sing in your mouth_ 2_ variety, there is more to Indian the palak paneer and tandori chicken and pakora_ 3_ Value great price for a wide range of options_ \n\nNext time you are in take a look at the left end of the buffet first and see if you can find a Chaat_',)("Looooove this place! They food is great and the prices are better_ The lady that runs the waitress side reminds me of going to a place in New York_ She walked up to a table and said _eat your rice!_ I love it!!! She's like an Indian mom_ We love her! Excellent place!",)('I use to love this restaurant until my friend found a roach leg in her water and there was stuff floating around in another_ Disgusting! Never coming back here again_ They still had the audacity to charge us after all of this_',)
