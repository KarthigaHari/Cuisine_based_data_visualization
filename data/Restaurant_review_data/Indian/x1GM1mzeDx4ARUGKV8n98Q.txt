It was horrible_ \nI gave up at the point, because I was already full from all of the tortilla, cheese, and onion___it came with beans, but no salsa_  \nI then ate one quarter of the fry bread, which was great to see that they actually prepare it for you, makes it so much easier to eat in quarters_  The fry bread was  good, it was very thick so I couldn't taste much of the honey or the sugar_  I guess I am used to fry bread being more airy, light, and fluffy vs this dense_\nAlso, I guess I prefer my machaca burrito to actually have some machaca entirely throughout the burro_ \nI would eat here again if I were hungry for something different, but I would stick with the fry bread_\n\nThe service was great, the man who helped me was very communicative and appeared to be genuinely jovial, which is always great to work with these types of owners_employees_",)("Best Mexican food I've ever had!

I should have known when I walked into a gift shop to pick up my food that it might be a tourist gimmick and I should have listened to my gut_ The fry bread topping was tasty but the actual bread was more of a flavorless donut than an airy frybread_ I was embarrassed for them when I took a bite into my flavorless taco_ I'm not exaggerating when I say the chicken was flavorless and it was so dry and crusty, the ends were crispy but not from cooking it_ I would co pair it to jurky more than taco meat_ I will never return unless I need a decently priced tourist nick knack_",)("Superb, fun, not for snobs_  Bart is a terrific host, and, yes, the front of the store is the best kind of tourist trap, but what's served out back is authentic and awesome_ This is a place I crave if I don't get there for a couple weeks_ Go soon and often_",)('Wonderful place for a quick bite to eat - we got the honey Indian bread (sweet warm and delicious)_ The _special_ which was our favorite, had a small kick to it but nothing too strong, and the chimichanga (good but not as good as the other 2_  They have a small place to sit in the back or outside',)("I can't believe I just found out about this place!!!
