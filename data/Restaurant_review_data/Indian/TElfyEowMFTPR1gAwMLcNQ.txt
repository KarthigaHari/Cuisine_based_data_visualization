('Talk about excellent food! I can never get enough of the chicken tikka! Buffet or Menu this restaurant has excellent food! The vegetarian food on buffet is second to none, even on the lunch buffet_ The pricing is great too for such good food! I highly advise all to try Copper Kettle',)('I ate at this place years ago when it was at its old location and would not have recommend it_  I loved the restaurant that was previously at this location, before Copper Kettle moved in (Indus Village), but sadly they closed down_  \n\nLast year I ate at Copper Kettle and it was horrible_  But I have been here twice in the last month for their dinner buffet, and the food has been amazing each time_  They must have a new cook, because I am now a fan_  Could be a tad bit cheap though_',)('we ordered chicken biryani and naan_Both of them were really bad_\nchicken biryani tasted like tamarind rice and naan is very o;d_\nworst food I have ever had_waste of money_',)('The best Chicken Tika Masala I have ever eaten!\nGreat friendly service_  Great selection on the buffet and very flavorful_ \nThe naan is fresh and delivered hot to your table_',)('There seems to be a problem with everything in this restaurant, including the people who serve_\n\nWe first ordered Alu tikki__ We were given 2 pieces in a plate__ but no fork or spoon or knief to eat__ not even individual plates__ we had to call the waiter for each piece of cutlery, again and again_\n\nThen we ordered, Mix veg curry__ and when we got it, all it had was peas and carrot_ I told the chef that there seems to have been a mistake in order_ But he had the audacity to tell me that this is how mix veg curry is prepared in that hotel__ \n\nForget the food, they dont even have the courtesy to treat people nicely_ I never want to set foot into this place again!!',)("The food was fair to medium; however, when we presented a purchased Copper Kettle discount coupon management rejected it on the grounds the restaurant had recently moved its location and the address on the coupon was no longer relevant, voiding the coupon's value_ This is the first I have encountered a bait & switch restaurant scheme_",)("We had similar experience last time but we thought of giving another chance when a friend insisted_ \nBuffet dishes were in Really bad condition, looked old even though it was Friday evening_ \nThey promised to give fresh nan, once came out and said 'naan jal Gaye, making again'_ Second attempt naan were under cooked_ \nOwners: Please get professional cook and staff if restaurant needs to continue_ Staff was really friendly and seemed nice people but that's not enough for a dining place_\n\nTake out food is always tasty though_",)('Highly recommended___ Great service__ Reasonable price__ Buffet selection is perfect__ Will definitely coming back__',)("Had buffet - really disappointed_ They don't have appetizers and call it a buffet and very far from authentic Indian food",)("I order take put from here and the food is great_  The chicken tikka masala is delicious_  I love the Channa masala, samosa, and garlic naan are awesome_  It has been pretty slow when I pick up my food (which I don't understand since the food is excellent)_  I had the okra balti today and it was a hit with my family_  Check the place out_",)("I was a big fan of their location in Mesa_  I'm glad they're a lot closer to me now_\n\nThe food here is good and flavorful_  I have no complaints_  As long as they continue to serve at least one goat dish on the weekends, I'll be happy_",)("Been to this place a few times and I definitely recommend it_ The buffet is great and so is the service  I haven't ate here in a while and really need to go back!",)("I have had take out twice recently_ The first time I placed my Oder, it was never put into the computer and the girl who took my Oder went home_ They were friendly, apologetic and quick to prepare our food_ It was tasty but not the best I've had_ The paneer tikka masala was what  we ordered_ \nThe second time we ordered we got the palak paneer, lamb korma and the paneer tikka masala_ This time around the food was mainly oil!!! The lamb korma looked like oil with lamb in it_ I'm not exaggerating_ The palak paneer was fairly tasteless and oily as we'll_ the tikka masala was oily but tasty still_ \n\n After tonight I will not be returning_ I doubt their food is always  this oily but I would rather not risk it happening again_ The amount of oil was almost comical it was so much_",)('Better than most of other Pakistani restaurants_ Sometimes they are weird with their servings burn the hell out of food pr serving is too less_',)('We eat _Goop_ for lunch once a week_ The lunch buffet is great_ I love all the vegetarian dishes and usually stuff myself_\nWe are always greeted immediately when we walk in and our drink orders are brought to the table with fresh naan as soon as we get our plates filled and sit down_\nThe owner is very nice and we love eating here_',)("I have been to Copper Kettle multiple times and in the past and when i say past i am talking about couple of years ago when they weren't at there current location_ \nSo i was at copper kettle couple of weeks ago with my family for their buffet and long behold the food which was being served i can swear was from the night before_ I mean come on people make some fresh food if you want people to come back and eat_ I told me family this place was so good when i was doing my rotations that i have to go there again but was extremely disappointed_ The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because it was clean and the Naans were fresh and good :)",)
