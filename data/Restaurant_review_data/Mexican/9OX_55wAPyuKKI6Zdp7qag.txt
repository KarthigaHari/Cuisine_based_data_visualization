("Very authentic food, I'm a huge fan! I don't know much about the West Valley, I only work out here so I was very happy to find some great Mexican food_ Family owned and has been in the area for over 40 years_ I highly recommend it to anyone in the area_",)("Service was very slow_ Waitress put chips on table, left didn't ask what we wanted to drink_ Finally came back dropped off salsa and left again_ When she returned wanted to know if we were ready to order_ Still hadn't got drinks yet_ Don't try to order anything slightly different from the menu even though they have the same ingredients_ They will not do it_ So we left_",)("My family and I went last week_ The way I like to rate Mexican places is by their chips and salsa_ If they have good salsa, normally their food is good_ If their salsa is full of flavor, their food will also contain flavor_ Tis place had good salsa that was spicy_ So, I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were in almost a tomato sauce_ Not a lot, just a little_ First reaction was huh? But then I tried it_ Oh my they were very yummy! I darn near licked my plate when I was done_ The only complaint I would have was the rice_ Not sure if it was yesterday's or just undercooked_ But_____ Everything else was very good_ The place is small, so be prepared, probably only 15 tables_",)('This place was great! Found this on a search while we were in town for Spring Training games_ Tastes like real authentic Mexican food_ Will be back for sure_',)("This place is an absolute dive, not even worthy of the one star I'm forced to leave to place this review_ We sat in the restaurant for over a half an hour the waitress managed to bring a basket of chips with no salsa_ We could not even get a glass of water and the place was empty_ When we got up to leave the waitress said sarcastically did you change your mind_ And when I responded that we had sat there for a long time without so much as a glass of water she just laughed as we walked out the door_ Avoid this hole and try Raul and Theresa's one block down the street the food is fantastic as well as the service_",)('My favorite Mexican food place :) been going here for years, ever since I was a kid_ Service is excellent, aphonsphere is nice, and the food is delicious! I love this place_',)("I've been coming here since I was a kid_ And now my high school mates and their family run the restaurant passed down from their family, and excellence in the food family fun atmosphere is always welcomed private family birthday parties As well as my family coming from out of town still wanting to come to the small yet wonderful restaurant_ Blessings to all thanks Aaron for taking care of us all in the kitchen",)('Great food, friendly atmosphere, way better than the place next door___prices good__salsa amazing',)("A group of us found Tony's after Raul & Theresa's was too busy_  And we have been back at least 6 times in the last few months_  The waitresses are so very nice and friendly and great to deal with!  The food is DELICIOUS!\nEvery time our group has gone each person is happy with their food, either it's gone or it's so good and great for leftovers!  \n\nIt is a very small location so there may be times you will need to wait, our last group was 12 and we had stellar service!",)('Laid back Mexican restaurant, good service, quality food and excellent beverages_ The overall quality of service was the best part, the food could have been better but I certainly was not complaining_ I would return again if in the area',)('Great food, incredible value_  Friendly service_  The restaurant is very small, perhaps once a small home, however, there is usually plenty of room and they can accomodate nearly any sized party_  If you are looking for a good meal, without a lot of ambiance, this is the place to good in Avondale_',)("I have been a Tony's regular for over 30 years_  I have never had a bad meal_  My husband loves the #3, chili relleno, beef taco, rice and beans, I get the #1, tostado, taco, cheese enchilada, rice and beans_  The restaurant is small, but huge compared to what it was when it opened about 40 years ago_  It is a family owned business, sometimes Tony is there, just sitting at a table, he doesn't work there any longer due to age and health_  My daughter in Iowa insists on eating there numerous times when she comes home for a visit_  It is not the fancy, lettuce covered mexican type food that you find at places like Macayo's or Garcia's, just good, traditional mexican food_  The quesadillas are the best as are the chips and salsa!",)("Went out with my bf last night in search of some excellent Mexican food_  Preferably a new place, but the places we found on the west side weren't exactly blowing our minds, if you know what I mean_____  We stumbled across Tony's and were very glad we did_  The hot sauce that came with the chips was spicy but not too spicy_____  We enjoyed it quite a bit_  We both ordered the reasonably priced margaritas, which were grande!  Both in taste and size_  We ordered combo plates (#1 and #6) that included tostadas, tacos, enchiladas, and a burrito_  The food was served nice and hot!  The service was excellent, and our overall experience was great_  Will definitely be coming back!",)("Based on recommendations from friends I decided to try Tony's Cafe for lunch today_ The service was great and the staff was very pleasant_ I ordered the Carne Asada plate and was disappointed with the steak_ The flavor was great but the meat seemed overcooked_ It was tough and difficult to cut especially across the grain even with a steak knife_",)("My wife and I have been looking for a Mexican Restaurant with reasonable prices and excellent food_ The place was reasonably clean and service wasn't bad_ My low rating is strictly because of the food_ I had a taco and enchilada plate with rice and beans_ The tacos hardshell like like you get from Taco Bell_ I definitely would not call this authentic  Mexican_ Do yourself a big favor_ Go to Carolina's on Dysart and MC 85_ They make fresh flour tortillas in front of big glass windows awesome! A must try is their TAMALES! Best I have ever eaten from a restaurant_ Rivals some that are homemade_",)("My very favorite go to Mexican restaraunt_ Have lived in the valley since 1988 and hands down from the friendly staff, delicious iced tea, salsa and chili rellenos to write home about this place is frickin fantastic!!! Don't let the trailer appearance scare you off, be brave you can do it! Your bravery will be well rewarded!",)('Best I mean best Mexican food I have ever had_ This will be a regular spot now for my family and I_ So glad that we found this place_',)("Taco love_ This place passes all my requirements_  Local, family owned, real ethnic food, and yes divey_ Not divey in bad way_ \n\nWhen the fork goes in the crunch is audible_ Chicken Chimichanga was crunchingly condiment ally perfect_  Yes I make up words_ Ample sour cream guac and salsa_  Block building, check, daughter of the owner smilingly serving perfection, check, not in a strip mall? Check check!!  \n\nTry everything, it's a command_",)("My absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant!!  I have been going since I was about 5_  Don't let the outside appearance scare you away the food is amazing!!!!",)("I like Tony's a lot for the quick hole-in-the-wall Mexican type-deal_  Their tortillas (pretty much the most important part at a place like this) are very good, and they have great, fast service_  The salsa is fantastic too, if you can handle the heat_",)("Some of the best Mexican food in the far west valley, place is small but attentive_ Green Chili is my go to for new restaurants and they didn't disappoint me_ This place hasn't been in business this long without serving good home cooked meals",)('Dinner time, service was very friendly \nFood portions were a great value and the food was very good_  Green chilli was outa this world along with the chilli rellano_ \nI recomend driving from anywhere in phoenix  to enjoy great cooking and a huge 4_75 margarita',)("I stopped in here last Friday before my boyfriend and I hit the road for Tucson_ He suggested the place and I'd never been there, so I had no idea that the tiny little building we passed all the time was actually where we were going_ Parking here is ridiculous, they certainly didn't plan it very well when it was built or it was never intended to be a restaurant_ Whichever the case, we went in and were greeted by a friendly woman who would also be our server_ \n\nThe place is just as small on the inside as it looks from the street, but its got a sort of Mom & Pop charm_ This could have been that there were two waitresses_older ladies in aprons sitting at a table speaking in Spanish, a little girl playing on that side of the room, and an elderly gentleman just sitting at a table listening to them (not eating, or being helped by any of the staff)_ Either way, it was cozy and nice_ \n\nI found it strange, but not annoying to sit right under a television while we ate_ Hey, I enjoyed the Judge Joe Brown episode we were in time for_ The prices for our food were very reasonable and we were given chips and homemade salsa while we waited_ Just a few minutes later, maybe 10-15, our food was ready_ Everything was good and hot, but gave me heartburn & an upset stomach later_ For this, I blame my boyfriend for not telling me until after the fact that he'd gotten sick once eating there because the food was just too heavy_\n\nAnyways, solid 3 stars_",)("My Family's second visit here_ Love the food!! If the chips and salsa are good you know the food is gonna be bomb!!!",)('This is my favorite Mexican restaurant! I lover their chicken enchiladas_ Unlike so many others, they use white meat and they are really great_ My wife usually gets the chimichanga or tacos and raves about both_ I love small hole wall places like this!',)("We drive by all the time and never know when it is open_  We finally hit the jackpot today!  It is just a hole in the wall_  Tony's is spotlessly clean_  The service is very friendly_  \nI ordered the huevos rancheros_  It was a little different than I have ever had them, but boy were they delicious!!!  My husband had chorizo and scrambled eggs_  He was trying to lick his plate_  \nThe food comes out bubbling hot, literally_  \nThe downside-they only have regular coffee, no decaf_  My husband had the coffee and said it was very good_  They also only serve powdered creamer_   It was also very cold in there_  I can't wait to go back again!!",)('You might drive past but that would be a mistake !\n\nHuge portion of authentic food_ Prices are spot on and flavors are as well_ Go there once and you will go often',)("Love this place, such great food!! If you haven't tried it, it's a must! The place is small, so get there early and grab a table_ You won't be disappointed_",)('I love this place always has good food and the guacamole is amazing ice been going here for years_',)
