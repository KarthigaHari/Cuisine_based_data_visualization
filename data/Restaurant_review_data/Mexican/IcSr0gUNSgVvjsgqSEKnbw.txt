We live nearby and went for breakfast one day and were thrilled with food and service_ Went back soon after for dinner with friends_ Had a good experience all around with good food-except for the soggy vegetable medley _ None of us could eat it and we all are veggie lovers_ Seemed reasonable for the 4 of us and did not notice extra charges_  So went tonight with hubby after getting the email about _12_99 all you can eat chicken_ Now for tonight's experience___ordered drinks which were supposed to be _2 off - didn't happen when the bill came_  Ordered one salad, shrimp appetizer, chicken to share_ No pepper offered for salad-had to ask and waited through half the salad_ Asked for bread-came with oil and vinegar_ Charge-_3_ Asked why the charge and manager said it comes with some dinners_ WTF_ Guess our meal didn't warrant bread let alone butter_ Then the chicken was charged full price with charge for extra plate split_ Okay_ Server said it was a _secret _ email price and you had to mention it_ Duh me bad_ Bottom line here - there are too many good restaurants in this town with better service and not nickel and diming guests_  Sorry this neighborhood place is off our list and we won't be recommending to our neighbors and friends_ The manager came to our table and reduced the check and made several apologies_ Sorry but that didn't change our opinion of the place_ Avoid it_",)("Was looking forward to Father's Day brunch as Soul Cafe has always been a go to spot for great food_\n\nOur experience started poorly_ They had lost our reservation that had been made 3 days prior_ Thankfully they had a table to accommodate our group_\nFrom there we were treated to a poorly run debacle which included slow drink refills, food that took over 1:15 minutes to come, incorrect orders and total confusion_ \n\nAfter about an hour of waiting one of our group members was told that the dish she had ordered was no longer available_ It took an hour for them to figure this out?!? \n\nIt took nearly 20 minutes from the time the first dish came out until we all had our food_ There were only 5 of us_ When all 5 dishes had come, 3 of the 5 were not what had been ordered_  It also took them that long to get us place settings_ Seriously? No napkins and silver wear for almost 1_5 hours after we had been sitting?\n\nUpsides, the servers and manager were super nice about everything_ After watching them apologize to nearly every other table for similar issues they were obviously flustered but treated us well_ Also, the food was great! Right on par with Soul Cafe which is always excellent_\n\nNeedless to say it will be a long time before I try this place again_ Our first try was a very, very crummy experience and I have totally lost faith in this place_ I hope they get it together soon because if this keeps up doors will be closed in no time_",)('We went early on a Sunday morning_  Great food, great service_  I did not partake in the Mimosa Tray, but will go back as it looked amazing_  Lemon Ricotta pancakes as big as a platter and TASTY!!',)("Great for groups! We went with 16 for Sunday brunch_ Awesome service, great food (everyone loved what they ordered), perfect back area for our group_ Our server did a great job, food was surprisingly quick and loved the mimosa tray! Will definitely be back for bloody Mary's and eggs Benedict! Patio also looks great for sunset and a fire_",)
