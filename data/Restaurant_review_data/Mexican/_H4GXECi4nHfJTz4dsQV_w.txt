I think most people aren't used to the fact that this is not a Chipotle where there are all sorts of toppings_ Literally meat and the tortilla_",)("Chile Verde!  Good, clean n fast service_ Ordered Mole & Chile Verde burritos_ Only Chile Verde is good, not impressed with Mole_ But Chile Verde burrito does not comes with vegetables_ They don't serve beans on the side for additional fiber___so, eat more fruits & veggies else where_ 4 stars for Chile Verde_",)("Stopped in here for breakfast a few mornings ago_ I've had a lot of breakfast burritos from many different places and have to say that the tortilla sets up the whole burrito_  That being said, the fresh tortillas here are legit! They are awesome_ I gave it three stars solely based on the tortilla_  I have to say that the rest of the burrito was disappointing_ The bacon and hash was way, way too salty and had lots of pepper_ It really made the burrito hard to eat_ I'm curious to try another type of burrito, but not sure I'll be wanting to take the chance_\n\nAfter a few more visits, I'm happy giving this place 4 stars_ The breakfast burrito I've tried again, and it wasn't salty, like before_ Other burritos I've had are also pretty good_",)("I tried the Double H burrito_ Super thin burrito_ That about 7 pieces of meat that were super rubbery and could not eat_ Toritilla tasted fresh but other than that there was nothing really notable about this burrito_ No flavor whatsoever and would not get it again_\nExtremely disappointed since I have several friends that have been raving about this place_ Perhaps this was just a fluke and should I go back I'd be happy to update my review_experience_",)("Went to Rita's Burritos on Saturday morning for breakfast_ The eatery was tucked away in a shopping center on AZ Ave_ and Ocotillo_ The person at the counter was very friendly_ My husband and I both had the bacon hash burrito and he also had a bean and cheese_ The ingredients were very fresh and the tortillas were hand made and very delicious_ We sat outside at a table, the inside was full and the owner came out and made it a point to ask how the food was_\nThe only draw back to this Resturant is the size_ Also, the burritos were a bit smaller then I am used to, otherwise very good_",)
