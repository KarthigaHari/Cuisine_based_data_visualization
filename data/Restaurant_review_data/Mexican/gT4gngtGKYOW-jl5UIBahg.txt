Amazing food, great customer service & friendly atmosphere! This is a small family startup restaurant for which I could definitely see great potential for in the near future! Small improvements to be made but I am sure they will come once this place starts getting the attention it should be getting!! If you have not tried this place you have to_ When my family and I first walked in her ( I have to be honest) were a little skeptical but in the end we are so glad we did! Don't be fooled by the furnishings and decorations (they are just starting guys)_ This is REAL Mexican food reminds me of back home_ BTW they make fresh handmade tortillas from scratch!!!

It tasted like my grandma made it at her house for my little cousins birthday party! So happy_ It came with tortillas, cilantro onions and cabbage_\n\nMy boyfriend had the tostadas_ They are a little different because they mix their meat with potatoes so naturally he was a little skeptical_ He really liked them however! \n\nPricing is good for a place that has a server_ Our server was friendly and he ended up talking with us for a while_ We figured it was because we were the only ones left but he definitely didn't have to since they were closed already_ He didn't make us feel rushed at all_ \n\nGreat food and good customer service_ We will definitely be back! Thanks Victor !",)("Amazing food! Discovered this place about a month or 2 ago_ First time having Sinaloa style sushi but definitely did not disappoint_ The sushi takes a little longer than normal food orders to prepare but worth the wait_ I usually get the culichi which is on the menu a house favorite_ Last visit all 4 of our party ordered one roll each and they were HUGE, nobody was able to finish there roll would recommend sharing_ Micheladas are a must, ordered with modelo especial_ Tacos and flautas (rolled tacos) are delicious too, tacos have home made tortillas and flautas I generally don't get wowed but these sure did, pretty safe to say from our couple visits everything there is good_",)('Good food, good quick service!
