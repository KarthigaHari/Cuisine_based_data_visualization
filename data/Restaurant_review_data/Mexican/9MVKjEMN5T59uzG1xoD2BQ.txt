("Leo used to work for Z'Tejas for years_ Looking over the menu I can see he stole(copycat) some of the items from Z_ Yet Cocina Madrigal looks a little more expensive_",)("I drive by this area everyday and saw the new restaurant sign  \n decided to look on Yelp and see what the reviewer were saying_ I saw excellent reviews and decided to bring my whole family in for dinner tonight_ We were greeted by the sweet and helpful hostess Yazmin (not sure on the spelling)_ She seated the 6 of us_ We told her we came in because of the Yelp reviews and we excited to see a mom & pop place in south Phx_ She was the daughter of the Chef_ Her lovely mother brought us homemade guacamole and chips to start off our meal_ The guac was so thick and flavorful_ We ordered a round of margaritas on the rocks and also order the Trio!! Then on to our entrees _ The food came out looking amazing and each bite was full of flavor_  The Beans & Rice were delicious __You can mix and match the Tacos too_ One of the owners offered for us to try the frozen margaritas_ They offered a powerful kick and made without ice_ Absolutely amazing and gave you a nice buzz_ After we finished our main course we had to try all the desserts_ I honestly enjoyed each one and can't even give you a favorite _ Each one was delicious in its own way_ We finished everything !!! The Chef stopped by to say hello and it really felt like he cared about his customers__ This will be a staple for us to visit_ Welcome to the south mountain family Cocina Madrigal__ love this new place!!",)
