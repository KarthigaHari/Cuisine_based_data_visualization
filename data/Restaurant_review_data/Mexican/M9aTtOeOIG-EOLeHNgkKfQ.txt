('Had the Carne Asada burrito, it was fresh and delicious!! Plus watched novellas and hot women on Univision :) great quick spot for lunch for downtowners that want good Mexican food_',)("I discovered this spot after searching for a new place for carne asada burritos after witnessing a nose picking incident at my old burrito spot by one of the food preparers__i know gross right_ But I'm glad I found this place its closer to home and the food is amazing and carne is always fresh_",)("Legit, delicious food_ \n\nA few pals and I came here after volunteering at a school nearby_ When we drove past in the morning, we knew we'd have to forgo the volunteers' lunch and save room for this_ \n\nI went for cheese enchiladas while my dining companions got various tacos_ Their enchilada sauce was super flavorful as was the hot sauce (which I always drench my food with)_ Didn't love the refried beans but otherwise my meal was on point_ \n\nBonus for the meat being grilled outside, so you can follow the scent into the restaurant, knowing you're in for a treat_ \n\nAlso, the place is nice and bright and clean_",)('Went in on a whim to try their Tacos Al Pastor, and I was not disappointes_Fantastic little hole in the wall place, very clean and very nice staff_ Will definitely come back for seconds_',)("It was alright_  I mean, the portions were generous and the service timely, but nothing special_  The flavor fell flat for me, so I can't say I'll be returning, but I don't feel like it was a waste of money_",)
