("I have been to El Chiltepin about 4 or 5 times now and every time, I am just impressed with the quality of their food_ I consider myself well versed in South Phoenix Mexican restaurants and this little dive is easily top three in terms of taste and quality_ Don't let the exterior fool you, this is a hidden gem in South Phoenix_ \n\nSo what sets it apart? First of all, the salsa, both red and green, are perfect_ They have a subtlety of flavor that is absent from the salsas of other Mexican joints_ The have the right spice level and both have a unique taste_ I can't tell which is better, but they are different and add interesting complexity to the food_ \n\nSecond, the food is well made with quality ingredients_ I have had tortas from most of the restaurants in the area and they are not as tasty as here_ The bread is quality as well as the meat used for the carne asada_ The cheese is quality Mexican queso and it has a rich creamy flavor that is missing when I go to other joints_ Finally, the quesadilla montada de carne asada may be one of the best quesadillas I have had_ If you go, check out this item_ It is fantastic_  \n\nFinally, I like the portion size_ Definitely enough to fill you up, but they don't overdo it like so many other places do_ Quality of taste and ingredients is the first priority here, not quantity_ I guess some people want a burrito the size of an infant, but I appreciate a restaurant that can give you enough without making it feel like you are in a speed eating contest_  \n\nI know I am waxing poetic here, but I promise if you go, you won't be disappointed_",)('I work next door and make sure to come here atleast once a week_  By far the best mexican food in the area_  Everything they make is incredibly fresh_  I love their pork and their Carne_',)("We had the quesadilla montada, and the al pastor and green chili empanadas_\n\nIf you like meat lovers pizza, then you might like the montada_  But after 3 bites we found it too cheese and greasy meat heavy_  It's mozzarella, bacon, and carne asada_\n\nThe meat in the green chili empanada was terrible_  It was like some kind of really cheap ground beef_  I could't eat more than 1_3 of  it_  \n\nThe only highlights were the al pastor empanada and the horchata_  The al pastor was delicious with a hint of pineapple_  I would glady get this again - although there was not a lot of meat there_  The horchata was also very good with a distinct cinnamon flavor_\n\nWe really wanted to like the food after reading the New Times review but alas_____",)("I go to this part of town sometimes to visit_  We've gone several times to Chiltepin, as there's this dish called blondie or 'guera', I believe, that my sister's rave about (the name may not be advertised that way)_  I tried it and it was damn tasty - loaded with lots of veggies (pico-style) and other mexican-style ingredients (meats, beans, etc)_  They are good with portion sizes as I bought a burrito here that was ginormous___ and the beans were yummy_\n\nThe owners are a Latin (don't know their exact background) husband and wife couple and I'm pretty sure they do all the work themselves (ie_ prep, cook, serve, clean, etc) as I've never seen anyone else there_  They are very friendly and I think that friendliness_neighborliness and their food quality is the main reason my family and I still go here_  They seem to be improving from the first few months when we had tried them and their service was sssslloooow__ they are much quicker now (experience, I think) and their quality is still good_  I think they now accept card, but I usually pay cash to small businesses___\n\nI would suggest they keep their menu limited and not so vast__ especially for a new start-up, you want to make sure you can deliver what you say in a timely manner and not waste product__ if you have a surprlus of product because your menu is vast, you are wasting and not meeting your cycle time for customer service___ \n\nOut of all the shady taco_burrito_tostada places on Central in SoPho, I choose this one to go to because of the owners and operators_",)
