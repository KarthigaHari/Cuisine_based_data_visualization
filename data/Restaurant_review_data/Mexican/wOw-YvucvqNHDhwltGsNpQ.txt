Not only was it big, the shredded beef was moist and well seasoned_ Very good meal, very friendly staff, I'll think I'll cone here again when I'm nearby_",)('It is a Wednesday and they offer a sweet sweet oyster deal buy a dozen at _14_00 and get one dozen free_ The chips and salsa are a great starter they offer a big variety on the menu of sea food and the food is great_',)
