("I love Metro Brasserie_\n\nWhy?\n\nI've been to France a kajillion times and it's a quintessential corner French Bistro_  No, it's certainly not _The French Laundry_ which is not even a Bistro, but if you're looking for the classic experience, the food is spot on, great service and some good French classics for those that are looking for a reliable and delicious culinary excursion to France_\n\nSteak Frites are about as close as you're going to get to L'Entrecote as you're going to get outside of France_",)("Its been a long time since I've eaten anything for breakfast other than your standard US Egg_Diner food_ Metro is in a class all its own_ I seriously had the best breakfast I have ever had in AZ_  The service was friendly & professional_ Also, very helpful & knowledgeable AND PATIENT while describing the French items_ At our table we had eggs benedict, THE BEST eggs benedict I have ever had (not like the quail egg on a cruoton you get at T_ Cooks) beyond delicious salmon crepes,and the egg white omelette was even good for  being healthy_  I cant wait to go back bc I've heard (and now seen) the famous tempura bacon_ If you need a good breakfast, skip all the rest & come to the best_ You won't be disappointed!! This IS the ONLY spot for breakfast_ Not to mention an entire _hangover cure_ cocktail menu_ GENIUS!!!!!",)('I have eaten here several times_  It is my little slice of the French Quarter in Scottsdale_  The beignets were as good as they get___especially with the sauces that come with them_  \nI have also had the escargot which were superb, as well as the onion tart and the salmon, also great_  \nFor lunch, I have had the burger and it rocks, seriously!___oh, did I say the beignets were amazing?!\nEach time I have been there, the service has been great_  I love sitting outside on their patio___it has great atmosphere!',)("Stopped by twice this past week, a Tuesday and a Wednesday during happy hour_ What a shame the place was vacant_  Sat at the bar and enjoyed some wine and appetizers_ The menu looked scrumptious with some unusal choices not available elsewhere_ They bake their own bread and pastries_  I tried the fries with mushroom gravy and guyere cheese_ Yummy_  A ham and cheese sandwich with mornay sauce was excellent_  Staff is very friendly_  The food here is too good to pass by_ If you haven't been here it is worth the trip_  They have Sunday brunch too which will be my next visit_",)("I heard about this great restaurant, serving Rustic French Country cuisine, by a good friend of mine_ He raved about how wonderful Metro Brasserie was and knowing him and his tastes, he usually isn't too far off the mark_ So when I had the opportunity to pick a place for my girlfriends and I to meet, I thought what a perfect place to check out_ Metro Brasserie is located in Old Town Scottsdale near the chic Waterfront_  The Waterfront is surrounded by trendy boutiques, cafes and wine bars and it's a bustle with Phoenician hipsters and tourists alike_ We were all really excited to try this hip new place and feeling our stomachs grumble couldn't wait to indulge our taste buds in yummy delights_ It was a little bit busy, after all it was a sunny Sunday afternoon, during the busiest time of the day_ We were told the wait would be around 40 minutes for the patio and 20 minutes for interior sitting_ Without hesitation we decided interior seating would be best___did I mention we were all really hungry? Within 15 minutes the hostess seated us_ The restaurant was super cute and reminded me of some of the little french cafes at home, back in Canada_ Thoughts of Pomme Frites, Poutine and Croque Monsieur danced through my head_\n\nThe menu had a pretty nice variety of entrees on it and you could order either breakfast or lunch_ I really like when restaurants give you options_ By the way, who doesn't like a good breakfast?? That's a whole other conversation_ Anyway, back to Metro Brasserie - the waiter came to take our order, my friend couldn't decide between the French Toast and the Quiche_ Who better to ask then the waiter! My friend proceeds to tell the waiter she's torn between two items__French Toast or Quiche? Which is better?_ Seemed like a pretty normal kind of question for a waiter_ His response blew us away_ _Well, they're really different_ One is sweet and the other savory__ The table is silent and I'm sure we're all thinking the exact same thing___no shit! It was at that moment our excitement was replaced with disappointment and a hint of irritation_ Not only was the waiters personality drier than toast but let's just say he was seriously lacking character and manners_ We all put in our orders; a Burger for me, Belgian Endive Salad with chicken for my friend and the Mushroom Brie Quiche for my other girlfriend_ \n\nAn hour and twenty five minutes went by and no food_ Our waiter didn't stop by during that time at all - you think he would have advised us of a problem in the kitchen or even just apologized for the delay_ Nothing! Our food finally arrives and we begin to devour what seems like a precious jem_ The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare with Gruyere and the Pomme Frites and mayo were amazing_ The Quiche on the other hand was just okay, _nothing special_ and the Belgian Endive Salad with chicken was not the best_ Apparently, the Salad was also nothing special and had a strange flavored dressing on it that was clearly not enjoyable_ We finish eating and chatting and decide to call it day_ Mr_ poo poo waiter hadn't been by to check on us and after having had waited so long for a mediocre lunch we weren't terribly happy_\n  \nThe service was blatantly awful, the waiter was rude, and only one dish was really good___what to do? Being the somewhat decent consumer, we decide to leave a 10% tip_ Anything less would be pretty rude considering most of the food industry lives off the tips_ I could not bring myself to leave this fine establishment without saying something, I wrote a little note on the receipt that said _This is the worst service I've ever experienced!_ I really felt compelled to say something about our experience_ We're in the middle of a recession and eating out is a privilege that should be enjoyed_ So, shouldn't patrons be treated well when spending money in establishments?",)("Food:  Good to OK\nService: Good to OK\nOysters; Yummy\nLike Dottsy Z_, I haven't been blown away by anything, and I've tried probably a third of the menu_  Everything has been at least _good__ but considering the prices, I'm on the edge as to how enthusiastically to recommend the place_  Service has always been courteous, which goes a long way with me, but a few times the waits have been oddly long at times that weren't busy_\n\nThe French onion soup is a hit for me, although I'd like slightly less brioche_  Served in a mini-tureen, the gruyere is baked perfectly, overflowing the sides in crispy yumminess_  The pate plate is interesting, but much to my disappointment it's not a liver pate_  The frites are almost British style - hot soft and limp, fabulous if you like that style, which I do_  \n\nThe outdoor patio is lovely, but can be crammed with tourists toting mewling babies and screaming tots when the weather is nice_",)("I LOVE this place! I eat here at least once every other week or so, since I work down the street_ So I am not sure what Greg R is talking about, because none of the items in his _review_ have been on the menu for nearly a year now! Maybe he was as slow writing it as he claims the service was_ \nThe food is always on point and reasonably priced_ I also like the fact that they change the menu seasonally (while keeping some standbys intact_) \nThe french onion soup is to die for_ Rich beefy, oniony broth with a generous crouton and bubbly hot cheese - c'est magnifique! \nPomme frites, perfect_ Nothing better than fresh, real potatoes_ If there is one thing I can't stand, it is the standard frozen thing that passes for fries in most places these days_ Paired with the tender, seared hanger steak and I am in lunch heaven_ \nI usually have lunch there, but I brought a friend there for dinner the other night_ She absolutely raved about the striped bass_ I had the Tagliatelle with rabbit sauce_ I all but licked the plate clean_ We followed with the sticky toffee pudding and practically fought each other for each bite_ Next time we'll definitely order two! \nI don't know why people tend to complain about the service_ They knew me by name after my third visit_ Besides, it is a French restaurant_ If there is one thing the French don't do, it is rush through a meal_ Good food, good wine, and good company should be savored!",)("I really had high hopes for this place prior to coming here_  It being in Scottsdale in a really nice location and all___but I wasn't terribly impressed w_their food_  I mean, it was good___but the only thing that stood out was the fresh squeezed OJ_\n\nI was dying for some moules frites and was excited to be getting some here_  The mussels were really tender and the broth light yet full of flavor (I would have drank it all up if they'd given me a straw)___but the fries weren't hot or crispy enough___it felt like it was almost there___but didn't quite make it_  We also had the pate (which was good), the onion tart (which no one cared for that much), the french onion soup (which was okay), medallions of filet mignon w_blue cheese (great flavor & texture combo but on the salty side), and beef burgundy (which tasted a bit like stewed ropes)_\n\nI know we also had some desserts___but it must not have been very memorable because I can't think of it (and I'm a dessert person first and foremost)_",)("What a beautiful day to enjoy a delicious brunch out at the patio of Metro with the live music_ Yup, life is always good with great food and company_\n\nI got the French Toast this time, it was yummy! Very nice presentation,  two piece of triangle-shaped toasts along with some fresh blackberries, blueberries, bananas foster, cr me fra che and caramel sauce, sweet! Even though it looked_tasted more like a dessert, I still really liked it! The girls got the Quiche Lorraine, the Omelette, and the French Toast(yay!)_ We all enjoyed!\n\nWe had to (yes, we had to!) get the Beignets to share, that's the only way to mark a ending for a beautiful saturday brunch, emmm, I love the beignets and the raspberry dipping sauce!",)("After a couple of visits to Metro_____I can without a doubt say that I am a fan!  The food is always delicious and the service is excellent!  I first went to Metro in search of beingets, which are excellent and much better than Grand Lux Cafe's, but i fell in love with all the other savory dishes they have to offer_\n\nThe French onion soup is amazing, but you must try the Moules & Frites (Mussels and Fries)____they are sensational____and the portion is enormous!  They give you this herbed mayo as a dipping sauce for the fries___and with the hot crunchy fries___it is awesome_\n\nLast time I tried the duck, also a another winner_  It is breaded in a panko crust and served with spaetzle!  The good German girl in me really loved the spaetzle!\n\nDuring the cooler months, they have a great patio with lots of people viewing opportunities_  With all of the recent closures of the restaurants in the South Bridge center____let's hope that Metro sticks around!",)("The menu is not extensive but most of the dishes looked appealing_ As a huge fan of beets I started with the Roasted Beet Tartare_  My advice, skip it_  Flavorless_  However, the Pommes Frites shared by the table were fabulous_  For my entree I decided on the Rainbow Trout since  I just got back from a vacation in Montana and wished I was still there instead of back at work!  It was cooked nicely, although for me, the skin could have been a little crispier so it was edible_  No biggie, just left it on my plate_  The portions were good and for Old Town, I thought the price was extremely reasonable_  The atmosphere was pretty good although it was Tuesday night and therefore pretty slow_  We did have one customer come up to our table at the end of his meal and tell us we were being loud and obnoxious and they could not enjoy their meal_  Since we were six ladies enjoying a _book club_ meeting he might not have been too far off but several members of the staff came up later and told us it was nice to see people enjoying themselves and to not worry about it_  Based on my experience and other reviews I think I'll definitely be going back for happy hour!",)("I can't say the food was tastiest thing on the menu that night because I didn't have any, more like that exceptional Mojito from the extremely entertaining bartender that made this lady give it five stars_\n\n\n Stopped in for a pre-cocktail before dinner and didn't pay much attention to the crowd (just seemed like your run-of-the-mill insta French restaurant) and likely will go back for a Mojito next time I'm in town, yes, I know it's a French restaurant_\n\n\n Cheers!",)("Only been once - had the burger and fries both really good_ My mom had the croque monsieur really good too_\n\nService was very good as well_\n\nReally cool live music on the patio when we were there too made for great atmosphere_\n\nWould definitely recommend this place, only reason it isn't 5 stars is because it's a little pricey - _14 burger + fries but I guess that comes with the territory in old town scottsdale_",)("A friend and I had lunch at Metro Brasserie and though we liked the atmosphere of the place, the food left something to be desired_ We ordered the Crab Maison for a starter except it never came because the server failed to input the order_ Though he was friendly, he should have confirmed our order since he later admitted he was confused_ \n\nAs for the food that did arrive, it was only okay_ My girlfriend tried the Rainbow Trout, which was significantly overshadowed flavor-wise by the bed of lentils_ The dish might improve if the lentils were served as a side rather than a bed and also if the trout was served sans skin_ \n\nI ordered the Quiche Lorraine_ While I realize restaurants vary on their interpretation of Quiche Lorraine, I did not expect Metro Brasserie to vary so significantly_ The menu clearly stated smoked bacon (as expected with a Lorraine) as part of the dish, yet we were hard pressed to find or taste any bacon at all_ In general, the quiche was pleasantly light and fluffy but utterly failed in the expectation set forth by the menu and also the fact that it was called _Quiche Lorraine__ C'est la vie_ At least the side salad of greens and a light vinaigrette was nice_ \n\nIn the end, the company (my friend) saved the meal but I am not sure I would visit Metro Brasserie again outside of a happy hour -- i_e_ cocktails and appetizers -- that is if I can make the early limited hours of 3pm - 6pm_ Otherwise, I will save the main course for another restaurant_",)("Had breakfast here with my honey on the way to the airport to go back home to Cali_ \n\nThe restaurant was very clean and the decor was contemporary_\n\nWe were immediately seated and given menus and a glass of water_ I immediately noticed the menu consisted of a fusion of french and southern foods_ \n\nI ordered an egg white omelet, it came with potatoes, and toast_ I also had a mimosa_ \n\nMy husband ordered the quiche lorraine which came with a salad_ He also ordered a bloody mary_ \n\nWe also ordered beignets (we couldn't resist) which came with raspberry sauce, nutella, and a vanilla bean sauce_ \n\nThe food as GREAT and cheap! The raspberry sauce was good enough to write home and tell mom_ \n\nThe beignets was not as good as the ones you get from the famous Cafe du Mond in New Orleans but they were very tasty_ \n\nI wish we would have discovered this place sooner_",)("We enjoyed an outdoor Sunday brunch and the decor was very reminiscent of Paris_  The patio was a little funny because depending on where you sit, you can feel like you're looking right into the service alley next to the restaurant, but nevertheless, it makes for a nice environment_\n\nWe ordered the Ham Steak (with chicory coffee gravy, a fried egg & grits) and the Alsatian Onion Tart (with bacon & gruyere) and some coffee_  The ham steak was tasty and the sauce was flavorful_  The onion tart was lovely and the coffee was the perfect compliment_ \n\nThe walk back down the staircase to get to the underground parking garage can be a little treacherous - watch your footing!",)("Metro Brasserie offers the best value for your French dining dollar in town_  Compared to Vincent on Camelback, Christopher's, Zinc Bistro, Coup des Tartes and Sophie's French Bistro, Metro Brasserie is THE go-to French restaurant in Phoenix_  Metro Brasserie fills a HUGE void in this town by offering delicious French food at a reasonable price_  \n\nI really want to give this restaurant five stars but I just can't_  The problem is the menu_  It needs a re-write_  The descriptions are simplified to the point that the menu does not clearly set a diner's expectations_  The prime example was the dish my BF ordered_  The menu described it as _Poulet Rouge:  roasted chicken, Carolina-Gold rice, vegetables_ (_17)_  From the description, I envisioned roasted chicken on a pile of plain rice with a veggie medley_  When I asked our waiter, he clarified that the rice is actually a risotto and they take the meat from the wing and the thigh and blend it into the risotto_  The chicken breast is cooked and rolled in the crispy skin_  Hello?  That's nowhere near what I expected from the menu_  The two women seated near us who were conversing in French called the waiter over after they received their food_  The woman who ordered the chicken had to ask the waiter if she received the correct dish as she didn't recognize it_  The way the chicken breast is rolled and the skin is crisped, when the kitchen slices it into medallions to place on top of the risotto, it looks more like bacon-wrapped scallops_  It's fine to under-promise and over-deliver, but this menu is a clunker and it gets in the way of the excellent food_ \n\nWe started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes (_11)_  When the menu mentioned that they would be served with blue crab, I figured there would be a speck or two on the plate_  I was delightfully surprised when the tomatoes arrived absolutely covered in huge chunks of crab_  This is a generous amount of crab and the combination of the warm, crunchy tomatoes with the cool crab and the sauce remoulade was perfectly balanced_  \n\nThe doughy texture of the bread reminded me of the bread sticks at the Olive Garden with a harder crust_  They were good and the warm bread was nicely complimented with herbed butter_  However, I expect mini baguettes to offer up the traditional symphony of crunch that sets them apart_ \n\nBoth of us ordered the Frisee au Lardons (_9)_  I expected the salad to be frisee tossed with a warm bacon dressing served with lardons (bacon cubes), a poached egg and a crouton_  The menu mentioned a Creole mustard dressing, but I didn't expect the salad to be served cold_  When I asked the waiter about it, he said he would talk to kitchen because it was supposed to be warm_  On his second stop by the table after I brought it up, I finally told the waiter that the fact the salad was served on an ice cold plate (which would have been a good thing if the salad was supposed to be cold), likely contributed to cooling off the dressing_  However, the frisee showed no wilting at all so I don't believe it was ever heated_  The menu description needs to be tweaked_  I would not order this salad again given the cold dressing and I feel like the menu should have told me that_  Maybe a lot of folks who dine here aren't familiar enough with French food to have expectations for classic dishes like this, but the menu should disclose when they're monkeying around with a standard_\n\nI had the Brasserie Burger (_12) and it was utter perfection_  This is bad news for Delux as the burger here is flat-out amazing_  Order it_  You will not be disappointed_  It's the best burger in town_  I splashed out the extra _2 for the Pommes Frites_  They were delicious and serving them in a paper-lined mini metal bucket is genius because it keeps them warm_  \n\nThe BF had the aforementioned Poulet Rouge_  He's not the type of guy to order chicken in a restaurant, but both of us agreed we would order this dish again_  The breast meat was perfectly moist and the skin that was crisped around it was utterly delectable_  The one change this dish needs is more aggressive seasoning of the risotto_  Otherwise, this is fantastic and a screaming deal for _17_  \n\nTo round out the meal, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding (_7) and it was excellent_  The warm cake was a nice contrast to the pistachio gelato_  The ice cream arrived a bit melty on the plate, but the flavor combination was spot on_  The cr me fraiche was a really nice counterpoint to the sweetness_\n\nCheck out the crazy restrooms!  Like Christopher's, they are awfully spacious___ \n\nAfter enjoying a fantastic meal at Metro Brasserie, I am surprised that I didn't catch on that the concept of this restaurant is _French country meets the American South_ until I read it on their web site_  True, the fried green tomatoes should have been a huge clue, but it didn't come across via the d cor or the menu_   \n\nMetro Brasserie is our new go-to French restaurant_  We will be back!",)("I went to Metro last weekend with a friend after taking shots of a public art display along the canal, when we decided to check out some place new for dinner and Metro was the first thing that popped up_ As we walked towards the old Foodbar, we saw a lone guy with his Casio keyboard and a _5 light machine standing in the middle of the courtyard, entertaining the outdoor diners of both Digestif and Metro_ And when he broke into a hilariously bad soulman rendition of Michael Jackson's _Rock With You_ (OFF THE WALL, PEOPLE!) while the light machine did its magic, we knew we had to sit on the patio_\n\nOur hostess was friendly, told us about the recession-buster drink specials, and seated us outside_ I glanced at the menus she gave us- seemed a bit familiar, like Balthazar's in New York, but everything looked great_ They serve dinner on weeknights till midnight, and weekends till 2 am_ However, things pretty much started going downhill from there_ Our waiter came by and sternly told us, verbatim, _You guys were seated at the same time as three other tables, so I can't help you right now__ Huh? Um, ok_ Never before did I feel like I offended a server simply by sitting down_\n\nAnd his attitude got worse as the evening progressed_ While we were looking at our menus, I noticed that Metro served poutine in its late night menu (Poutine's a French-Canadian mound of french fries covered in gravy and cheese curds and a favorite of mine from childhood)_ I'd never seen this in Arizona, and so when the waiter came by, I smiled and remarked to him, _That's pretty cool you guys serve poutine! I haven't seen that here__ His response? _Well, you can't have any right now_ We don't serve that until 10__ What the fuck? I can READ, asshole_  I was giving your restaurant a compliment and you returned it by being a condescending ass_ My friend and I just looked at each other wondering if this was really happening_ \n\nI eventually decided to go with the steak frites (_19) and my friend ordered the salmon with spinach and fingerling potatoes (_18)_ As we were waiting for quite a while, the outdoor temperature started dipping pretty quickly and my friend asked a server if he could turn on the adjacent heat lamp_ One of the other servers attempted to turn it on, it didn't work, and just left it not working_ Didn't bother asking us if we'd like to move to a table near a working heat lamp_ Nothing_ My friend was getting cold, and also confused_ _Did we seriously do anything to piss these people off?_ she asked_ I shrugged my shoulders because I had no idea_\n\nAs our food arrived after 40 minutes or so, my friend's sister came to join us (we were assuming since we were at a 4-top it wouldn't be a problem)_ Apparently it was, though, because there was no, _Hi! Would you like to see a menu? Anything to drink?_ It was all her asking, _Excuse me? Um, hi_ Can I see a menu? And your wine list? Thanks__ Seriously, what is going on with this place? All three of us are here to spend money and are pretty nice people, but they could really give a crap less_\n\nI will say the saving grace of Metro WAS the food_ My steak frites were great (seriously, some of the best fries I've had in a long time) and my friend seemed to like her salmon_ We decided to go for the beignets for dessert, served with little dipping cups of nutella, vanilla cream, and raspberry coulis_ When they came, we asked for forks since otherwise we'd all have sauces all over our fingers_ Waiter? _Well, you're SUPPOSED to eat them with your hands_ Ok, I'll get you some forks__ My friend's sister turned to us and asked us, _What the heck did you do to this guy?_ Answer: Nothing_ That said, the beignets were great_\n\nSo, yeah, folks, I am pretty pissed_ Not just because as a paying and usually appreciative customer I was treated like complete shit by the waitstaff_ But because I really wanted to enjoy this place_ There's a Canadian connection there_ And the food is actually really good_ Had the service been just as good, or even at least remotely friendly, this place would be at least 4 stars, easy_ I really don't get why, in this economy when restaurants are hurting, a waiter will think it's a great idea to be so cold to his customers_ Does he actually want Metro to get bad worth-of-mouth about its service? My two friends are Scottsdale natives who love to eat out and often reserve large group dinners for birthdays and other occasions and he pretty much lost their business that evening_ I'm going to probably give these guys another chance, just to have their poutine, and hopefully have better service by someone else, and would gladly update my review if that happens_ But if service is the same, then these guys are off my list permanently_\n\nA really disappointing and bewildering experience more than anything_ Poor soulman singing _I Just Called To Say I Love You_ on his Casio keyboard couldn't even make us feel better as we left_ Alas_",)("The decor has changed slightly since the Food Bar was in operation here_  I did like the openness that they have created and the fact that now I can sit, order from a menu_  Of course with any new endeavor, there are ideas that may work and concepts that don't_  For instance, the idea of changing a classic French Onion Soup recipe, leave it alone, add salt, the prerequisite cheese (not the style that Metro added)_  \nThe service was attentive, but awkward (the logo company was still applying the lettering to the doors and windows), so maybe she was nervous and distracted?  I also ordered a field green salad with chicken and she said _It doesn't come with chicken__  So pointing to the menu (3 or 4_ charge to add chicken), _ It's printed here__  She replied, _ Oh, I learned something new today__ \nLike I said, new endeavors take time to cultivate and grow_  I will be back  -  enjoying a lunch on the patio, with an order of oysters from the raw bar, a glass of wine, and time to soak it all in_   Everyone deserves a second chance_",)('BEST BURGER i have had in the valley!!!

the blueberry galette is seasonal and won't be around for too long, try it_  We were very glad we took his advice_ My first comment to my husband was, _That looks nothing like a galette__  It didn't matter, the pastry and blueberries were still warm, topped by vanilla truffle ice cream and drizzled with lavender honey_  I don't think we put our forks down until it was gone_  I give that dessert 5 stars_\n\nThe only odd thing about our meal was the pickled okra in the bloody marys_  We've had marys there before and really liked them_  The okra just started to ooze a gelatinous substance after biting off the bottom_  I have to say it was a little off-putting_ I don't know if we just haven't had enough okra in our lives, but my husband only drank half of his_ The jokes we started making probably didn't help_  Of course, I still finished mine_\n\nIf you haven't tried Metro yet, this is definitely the week to do it!",)("I am going to keep this review pretty short just because it has been a few months since I have been there_ \n\nFirst off, the reason why the boyfriend and I ventured out of our typical dining price range (for lunch at least), is because we re total burger fans_ When the 2009 Best Of's came out we just had to try what the New Times thought the best burger in town was_ \n\nWe trotted into the Metro Brasserie around noon to find late-morning brunchers equipped with French omlettes,and steamed muscles and fries_ As appetizing as those were, we were dead set on their burger_ \n\nSimply put, their Metro Burger is fantastic_ Get it medium-rare to medium well and with everything on it (it comes on a deep golden brioche bun, topped with creamy sauce gribiche, sweet smoked Vidalia onions, tangy cured tomato, and Bibb lettuce_) It also comes with a mountain of fresh cut fries on the side_ Definitely worth the money (_13-15) and definitely worth the trip_ \n\nMy mistake of the day was getting a Peach Bellini (sparkling white wine with peach juice for _8)_ It just didn't hit the spot, and it did not compliment the meal at all_ If you're a Bloody Mary fan, go for it_ Everything is prepared fresh and it comes to you looking more like a crazy tomato smoothie than a cocktail_ \n\nThe dinner menu looked great, will try that sometime_",)("I hate the people who wright long negative reviews but I am EXTREMELY upset we wasted our time here_ \n\nLast night my boyfriend and I went on a double date to Metro Brasserie for Valentines day_ This particular Valentines happened to be particularly significant for us_ We had plans to start dinner at 6, grab some ice cream down the street, and had reservations at another function after at 8_ \n\nUpon arriving we found that our reservation was not for the correct time, however they were not busy at all and got us a nice table (right on the walkway) out on the patio_ When our server finally decided to come and take our drink order, we had had enough time to know our complete order, drinks, apps, and entrees_ When 7:15 rolled around we still did not have our entrees, someone came by and told us that one of our stakes was overdone, had to be re-fired and that it would be about 5-7 minutes longer_ At 7:45 we FINALLY received our food, my boyfriends burger was much too rare and sent it back (at that time we realized the server never asked how he would like it cooked)_ Since we had reservations elsewhere at 8:00 we threw all of our food into to-go boxes at an attempt to make it_ \n\nWe talked to a manager (who happened to be the person who told us that it would be 5-7 minutes longer PSH!) he took 50% off our bill, leaving our total bill for 4 people at _150! To top it all off, in our rush to make our next reservation WE FORGOT OUR FOOD WE DIDN'T GET TO EAT ON THE TABLE! \n\nI am so unbelievably upset that we choose to spend an extremely special night here and ended up, hungry, pissed off, AND missed our next reservation_ I will NEVER EVER EVER tell anyone one good thing about this restaurant, and it looks like were not the only ones_ \n\nTHANK YOU METRO BRASSERIE FOR RUINING 4 PEOPLES VALENTINES DAY!!!!!!!",)("Hostess: Would you like to sit inside or outside?\nMe: OUTSIDE! I'm from Chicago!\nHostess: In the sun or in the shade?\nMe: In the SUN! I'm from Chicago!\n\nAnd that's how our lunch began at Metro Brasserie on a warm February day_  You Phoenix yelpers don't know how lucky you are to be able to wear short-sleeves in February!!\n\nI'm not really a fan of French food and find it too heavy for lunch, but I can usually find something to eat on any menu_  And that something to eat at Metro Brasserie was the chicken salad sandwich served on a croissant_  Our waiter told me it was one of their more popular sandwiches_ Gabi K ordered a chick pea_eggplant sandwich, while the 3rd member of our party went with the turkey_cranberry sandwich_\n\nAbout 20 minutes later the turkey_cranberry sandwich arrived, but there was no sign of our meals for another 15 or so minutes_ Our waiter apologized profusely and said he didn't know why it was taking so long_  I was about to eat my arm by now (being on Chicago time it felt like an hour later), but we waited and waited and waited very patiently_\n\nOnce our food FINALLY arrived I really enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich___especially cause it was very light on the mayo_ I hate mayo___ick_  Gabi really liked her sandwich as well, although the turkey_cranberry sandwich went untouched because the 3rd member of our party was not such a fan_  \n\nAt the end of the meal our waiter offered to bring us complimentary chocolate cake to make up for the wait of our food, but we declined___these hips do not need anymore chocolate cake_  Still, it was a sweet gesture_\n\nOverall It was probably more of a 3 star experience, but I_m feeling a bit generous___the Arizona sun will do that to ya!",)('A good choice in old town for a nice meal_ Reasonable prices and good (not great) food_ They get bumped to 3_5 - 4 stars for the wine selection_ I ordered the Steak frites and was pleased_ The rest of our party was all over the menu with seafood and veggie selections_ All were pleased including a difficult to please out of town guest_ Get there early and order a Manhattan_ The name of the uniquely sweet cherries is gone following the second round of booze_ Attention to detail and great service_ We will be going back_',)("The wait staff were bitchy_ Burger was good_ Roasted chicken salad sucked_ But the deep-fried BACON (that's right) was well worth the trip_",)('I was hosting a brunch for my Moms 69th birthday and wanted something more interesting than our regular lunch_brunch standards_ We sat outside on the patio, which was perfect, we were a large party of 12 from 1 month to 69 years, and the service was charming, friendly and just the right amount of attentivness_ As far as food_drinks go-mimosas were wonderful the Bellini was one of the best I have had, we ordered just about the entire brunch menu and everyone was very happy_ Really impressed, and excited to go back for diner!',)("Before I forget, I need to say that the location is perfect, particularly on the patio in November when it's a dreamlike 70 degrees at 7:30pm_  \n\nWe were there last Thursday and the courtyard area of the waterfront had a peaceful level of pedestrian activity and a folksy band playing music nearby (including a flutist with her own unique Katie Perry interpretation)_\n\nWe started with the Oysters_ I am no shellfish expert but these looked fresh, and they tasted good, even better with a little extra horseradish and cocktail sauce_  We also tried the escargot_ The only low point of my meal_ I have had some pretty good escargot dishes in my day, usually swimming in a mild garlic butter sauce, however Metro's were doomed by a combination of rich green pesto and a breaded crust_ If they had stuck with the pesto sauce it would have been great, the crusty breading just made it a little too complex_ The poor little snail was overwhelmed_ \n\nA dinner companion started with a salad nicoise with poached egg_ I had a bite and it was excellent_ One of my favorite salads_ I love the taste of the cool lettuce and dressing with just a hint of warm, rich egg yolk_ \n\nFor my main course I had the roast chicken with mashed potatoes_ It sounds simple but was anything but simple_ The chicken was deconstructed, bones and skin removed, then the dark and white meats were put back together in a sort of roll, wrapped in the skin and roasted to perfection_ I never order chicken at restaurants because it's usually so bland, but this was fantastic_ Even better with the mashed potatoes and the small amount of mushroom & onion red wine reduction_  I could have used more of that sauce_ \n\nThe service was good, our waiter definitely knew the menu well and he was attentive throughout the evening and patient when our party was indecisive_  \n\nAnd on a final note, I finished the night off with a Keoke Coffee_ A family favorite_  Very flavorful, but the next day I had a horrendous hangover_ I think the bartender was a little too generous with the brandy_  Not that I am complaining, just a word of caution_",)("Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation_ Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate_ \n\nHaving the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic_ Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us_ \n\nI host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro_ \n\nThey have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore_\n\nUpdate 11_8_2010\nSince my first review I received a _50 gift certificate from the management of Metro_  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends_  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do_  \n\nWe arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio_  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again_  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full_\n\nJesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu_\n\nWe ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight_  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good_  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all_\n\nJesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section_",)("I have a soft spot for Brasseries_ And burgers_ So this place was an immediate win for me_ I have to say, I think Chelsea's burger was a little better, but I bet a lot of people would disagree with me_ Chelsea's is just a great burger - the way you expect a burger to be_ The Metro has an amazing fancy burger_ ;) Which as also absolutely delicious_ It just depends on what you're in the mood for_ I LOVE the atmosphere as well_ The wait staff was very nice_ The other customers were nice, and we wandered around Scottsdale aferwards_ All in all, a great place_ A friend mentioned that they have a fantastic brunch, so I'll be back for that_",)("LOVED IT!\n\nOk\nI love French food_\nI love cajun food_\nThus, I love this place_\n\nI came here for a Saturday brunch\nHad the croque monsieur_\n\nSo good!\n\nUnlike the croque monsieur's typically found in France, this one was served on a very thick French brioche type bread, and was filled with chipped ham and gruyere cheese, then topped with a bechamel sauce_\n\nOMG_\n\nVery rich, very unhealthy, very tasty_\n\nTo wash it down, I had some sort of champagne and elder cocktail_  Also delicious_\nI also thought it was very reasonably priced_\n\nI can't wait to come back and try more things at this place_",)("More to come from the 5 other yelpers in my party who had the same experience as I did_  I just wanted to beat them all to the punch_  To sum up what they will say in what I'm sure will be great detail:\n\n1_ The good-not-great, reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time_  \n2_ Now reading a bunch of other reviews here I see this isn't an uncommon story_\n3_  Most of the drinks we had were good, including bloody maries, but make your own mimosas by buying champagne and a side glass of OJ_",)
