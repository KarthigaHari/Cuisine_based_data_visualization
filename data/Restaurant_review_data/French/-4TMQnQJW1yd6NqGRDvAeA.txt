Maybe that would have been more promising_\n\nThere were many other items on the menu that I wanted to try_ I definitely recommend this place_ The quality of ingredients were superb and there were a variety of items on the menu to order_ Our server was excellent overall_ He chatted with us, was very attentive and gave us his recommendations_ \n\nIf you are ever in Scottsdale, check out The Mission first, then come here for a more upscale french influenced meal_",)("A most disappointing evening! We were greeted by our server,he took our order and we never saw him again!

Loved the food, loved the ambience, loved our blonde-haired waitress___ But what the hell was up with the intoxicated hostess? This girl was on one last night! She was WASTED! She was falling all over the place, slurring her words, oh and the poor _trainee_ she had___ She was so apologetic after seating us_ This intoxicated hostess couldn't even remember after 5 minutes while waiting for our table what our parties name was and if we wanted to eat inside or outside_ Girl, we just spoke to you 5 minutes before, get it together_ Poor thing could barely keep her balance_ Whatever she was on, it made for a very interesting start to our evening!!!",)("I popped in previously to book a group for a work meeting, but had never eaten there_ Even though my managers decided to eat elsewhere, the customer service left a positive impression_ The hostess greeted me by opening the door and a manger walked me through his favorite menu items_ \n\nI returned tonight to have appetizers and drinks with my dad and loved it_ We sat inside at the bar, which was crowded, but Heather, our server, and Ryan, the manager, took great care of us_ They knew the menu well, could explain the wines in depth, and treated us to some yummy desserts! The shrimp appetizer plate, date and espresso cookies, goat cheese cake, and glorified s'mores were all amazing_ Definitely coming back!!",)('Sometimes it is not destined to be a positive experience and this is a case of big disappointment_\nWhen you order in advance for a group and sample the menu and what you get is totally different from what you expected, there is something really wrong_ Not to mention the small portions and the huge quantities of bread to get you full and the total indifference from the staff - I CAN ONLY SAY THIS THIS PLACE SUCKS AND WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN____\nIt is a nice venue, but a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT_',)("Honestly, I wanted to love this place_  And it's not that it's bad, but they are missing the mark on the dishes I tried, albeit in easily fixable ways_  My first course was the smoked burrata_  LOVE the idea, not their result_  The burrata was very lightly smoked, as it should be, you don't want to overpower this delicate and luscious cheese_  I get that_  But a little adjustment is needed_  The MJ bread they served it with was white on white, tasteless and textureless_  You could hardly tell if it had seen a broiler or grill, it honestly looked and tasted like long rods of wonder bread, and the very little grilling or toasting the bread received just made it seem stale_   I love starches of all persuasions, beyond reason actually, but I left this bread on the plate after the first bite_  The cheese was simply served with a bit of vinaigrette, a bit of green onion, the bread, and nothing more_  I get keeping it simple and letting the cheese be the star, but it seriously needed something_  Perhaps a drizzle of a lightly smoked tomato coulis, a smear of parsley or basil pesto, or a little gremolata of finely diced preserved lemon with parsley and garlic, something to complete the idea, please!  And consider serving it with medium to large house-made olive oil fried croutons_  That would make a huge difference_\n\nThe duck confit bahn mi also fell below the possibility the dish offers_  There is a restaurant in the Seattle area that serves a version which qualifies for my short list for _last meal on earth_, so my bar for such a sandwich is admittedly high_  But The House could get there, or close anyway, with just a bit of tweaking_  First off, replace the MJ soft bread with a section of lovely french baguette (does MJ make one?), as should be used on a really good bahn mi_  And consider replacing the cilantro mint pesto with a sauce that would have a more complementary flavor profile, maybe a hoisin aioli, maybe a fruit based slightly smoky, not too assertive BBQ sauce (rhubarb?)_  To my mind, it would be greatly improved with a sauce that was slightly sweet, and with just enough of a balancing tang to cut through the rich fat, like one of the choices I mentioned, or a myriad of other options_  I would also add some caramelized shallots or onions to the duck_  And please, get rid of the mushy centered crinkle cut fries_  Seriously?  How about a little arugula salad with fried shallots and oven roasted tomatoes, or small round discs of a waxy potato (yellow finn or red bliss) cooked in duck fat, caramelized around the edges, or something else simple but satisfying_  Just something else, please_  The same frite they serve at Zinc Bistro would be a huge improvement, but just a little fatter would be even better, so you get more potato to balance the richness of the sandwich_\n\nBottom line, I will likely give it another try, see how it goes with different choices_  But my gut reaction is that a visit from a menu consultant with an impeccable palate is needed to turn this into a place I'll regularly want to visit_   \n\nAs an aside, I know I'll probably get slammed for dissing the MJ breads used here_  Yes, his breads are very popular locally_  And he does make some good breads, just not these two maybe_  But why oh why is there no truly great and complete bakery here in the Valley?  Essence in Tempe makes good baguettes, but doesn't sell them, darn, and doesn't make any other breads, only pastry, darn again_  There are a couple of restaurants and markets that make their own very good bread that they sell, or will sell if you ask_  Andreoli's and Christopher's come to mind, but each one only offers one or two types_  There is no single bakery I've yet found that has great baguettes, and loaves or rolls of campagnia, walnut, olive, ciabbata, pugliese, or assorted other rustic style breads_  Give me that, add some great pastries, and I'd be in heaven_  If anyone can steer me toward the great place I'm missing, I would be forever grateful!

The House Brisket was generally tasty, although the temperature was cold (how is that possible? We had just ordered and it came out so quickly!) and they were difficult to eat - the portions weren't single bites, but they were tough to cut into and divide into smaller bites as everything just sortof pulled apart_ The meatballs: When I think duck confit, I think juicy, fatty and flavor packed deliciousness_ These were a bit dry, and the sauce was very thin and difficult to sop up to offset the dryness_ They tasted okay but were generally a bit disappointing_ \n\nEntrees: My Filet was alright - it was cooked to temperature (medium) properly and the accompanying sauce had nice flavor_ The corn on the plate seemed like a bit of a throwaway; I always enjoy sweet corn in summer dishes, but this seemed to just be a filler_ My husband's braised pork was amazing - the accompanying apple and grits were just perfect and it was one of my favorite parts of the meal_ The Basil and Brie Smashed Potatoes were also a let down - the potatoes themselves were very basic fingerling potatoes with little to no flavor, and they were just smashed a little (I was expecting something a bit more mashed or perhaps crispy) Admittedly, Brie is not my favorite and so I avoided that element of the dish, so perhaps I was missing out on the most important flavor component__\n\nMy dessert was delightful - a pear (or apple? I'm pretty sure it was pear) upside down cake that was just so tasty_ I'd go back just for that_ My husband's chocolate banana budino was okay, but not super exciting_ There didn't seem to be any banana to speak of, so it was basically a quality chocolate pudding_ \n\nI had mentioned pacing, our food came out so incredibly quickly, we were actually in and out of the restaurant with three courses in an hour and 15 minutes_ I feel a little strange complaining about getting our food quickly, but it just seemed rushed, first with the amuse bouche and appetizers at the same time, and then followed by the rest of the courses hitting us so quickly one after the other_ It is the sort of meal you want to linger over, but I felt a bit pushed to finish by the way that it was paced_\n\nThe atmosphere was a combination of nice and not-so-nice_ They've done a wonderful job of transitioning the house into a beautifully furnished restaurant_ _ I didn't love the closeness to the other diners, especially the bachelorette parties in front of and beside us that got rowdier as the night wore on (general screechiness and shot-taking does not make for a romantic evening) The club-like music was out of character for the otherwise upscale and serious setting_ \n\nIt was weird, maybe we'll try again_",)("I was referred to this establishment from Cowboy Caio as they didn't have their Buffalo Carpacioo_ So I went to the house brasserie for their steak tartar which was a mistake_  It was a _FAIL_ for anyone looking for a traditional steak tartar as it came with fries, a small pigeon?
