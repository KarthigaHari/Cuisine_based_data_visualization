('Overpriced and underwhelming_ Have lived nearby for 4 years and thought we would finally go___what a mistake! Very disappointing_',)("I have never been so insulted by a restaurant___\n\nTook my 11-year old son to the _Voltaire_ to have his first Filet Mignon, since steak is his favorite food_ Thought we would do it right by going to an upscale French restaurant and we got all dressed up_ \n\nPut in an order for a Ceaser Salad and the Filet Mignon entree and planned to share it with my son_ Bad idea_ When the salad comes out, the head host guy comes over and says that we are required to each order an entree and that he doesn't want to serve us if we are going to share_ Says he doesn't like people coming to his restaurant for a cheap meal_ What the heck?!___a salad and Filet Mignon is _39_ So he had a standoff about it with me in the middle of the restaurant at my table and my son says to me afterward that he was shaking scared because of how rude this guy was_ A real-life Scrooge_\n\nWe left the restaurant quite offended_ The salad looked pretty sparse anyway_ Probably didn't miss anything_ \n\nTook my kid to Johnny Rockets instead and got 10 times better service from a high school kid_",)("We had a very good dinner last night; we took advantage of the 3-course meal for _28_ There were enough selections for each course and the food was delicious_ Our Caesar salad and Blue Cheese salad were very good_ The sandabs I had for an entree were cooked perfectly and my husband's chicken in puff pastry was quite large with very good chicken, spinach, and sauce_ I had the profiteroles for dessert- fabulous dark chocolate sauce, but the puffs were a little chewy_ My husband's creme br l e was rich and creamy_ Service by Erica was exactly right: attentive, informative, polite, and a good sense of humor_ Contrary to previous reviews, the gentleman at the door was very polite; he also came to our table a couple of times to ask if all was well_ The restaurant was busy and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food and the atmosphere_ I understand they will be changing the menu and decor while they close for the summer____I look forward to seeing the changes, but hope to return a few more times before the summer closure_",)("++++++++ France is a long way off _______ From Phoenix ++++++\n             ++++++++ The food is a long way off ____ From being French ++++++ \nAside from that _______ The items we had that evening ________ We're Very Good_\n\n           (+)  The Waitstaff is very attentive_\n           (-)   The decor inside _____ will make you feel ___ As you were dinning in a CAVE_\n           (-)   When it comes to Credit-cards _________ Visa or MasterCard ONLY_  \n           (+)  With a Groupn _________ Tax & Gratuity  _____ _58 for Two_",)("Good service, great food, small and intimate place good for a romantic dinner_ Don't pass up the seafood appetizer___ Perfect!",)("We went to Voltaire for my birthday 2 weeks ago with friends_ We had 2 for 1 coupons- there were 5 of us___\nThe place was on the small side compared to many restaurants, but cozy_ We were given a table in the middle of the room_ I did notice like others have said that the wallpaper was very dated, probably from the 70's_\nMy hubby and I both had a glass of wine, priced to the high side_\nI had a dinner salad that was nice, on the small side, but enough for me, mixed greens, tomato, vinaigrette_ He got the French onion soup which had a thick layer of cheese and he said was very good! We were served small, warm french rolls with cold butter pats with this_\nFor entrees I got a Filet Mignon, it was supposed to be Medium Rare but was Medium verging onto Medium Well- I was not a happy camper_ If it had been just the 2 of us I would have sent it back- especially at those prices, but I ate it_ It came with broccoli rabe which was cooked nicely_ My hubby had the duck_ I was VERY surprised to see that they used a thigh instead of a breast_ The waitress told us that was because it was juicier, it is also cheaper! He has had breast every other place he has had it and when cooked right- like at Adrienne's in New Milford, CT- it is wonderful, crispy skin, succulent meat_ So___not impressed!\nFor dessert I got creme brulee, it was creamy but had no flavor_ So, it was ok, but could have been much better_ With this, tax and the tip they added (which they do for parties of 6, but we were 5!!!) we were at _58_00 per head, after the coupon_ Compare this dinner to the one at Diamond Point Shadows_",)("Top notch restaurant_ My wife is a chef and we love finding great places to eat_ The service here is impeccable and the food is delicious_ The interior looks a bit dated and most of the customers are elderly, but those are stupid reasons to knock the restaurant_ Our waitress Helen was extremely attentive and kind, adding a nice French touch to the evening_ She even sang happy birthday to a customer with an angelic voice_ I've been here twice and both times were excellent_ Highly recommended",)("My husband and I tried this place out recently with a groupon, and we hated everything: the food, the service and the place_ First, the place smells like old fish_ The decoration is horrible, and you feel you are visiting your 90-year old aunt who hasn't taken care of her place since she was 50_ The Maitre D' has real issues_ He was on top of the poor waitress and micromanages the place to the point of making the guests uncomfortable_ Second, the food is nothing special_ We had the lamb, which came with potato puree and green beens swimming in butter_ The lamb was just OK, but nothing compared with dozens of other places around the valley_ The list of wines by the glass was limited and disappointing, and the creme brulee was nothing out of the ordinary_\nThird, they forgot to use the groupon when they brought the check, and when we reminded them the check came back with the tip included (18%)_ We thought this was incredibly rude_ I understand that some people do not tip for the entire amount when using groupons, but I don't think it is OK to include a 18% tip for a table of two without the customer's permission_",)("I just my first opportunity to have dinner there with another guest_  When first walking into the main dining room, you immediately see an outdated, windowless, low-ceiling environment that appeared and felt very stuffy_  I had a 6:30 reservation but showed up about 15 minutes early_  The maitre'd sat us in a table right next to the entrance of the dining room_  I asked if we could have a table away from the entrance since the room was not even 50% full_  He amazingly said that all the tables were not available_  The dining room never filled up for the 60 minutes that we were seated_  Strike one_  We perused the menu and saw that there were only 2 fish entrees and no vegetarian entrees_  Strike two_  My guest ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, and I ordered the sandab entree_  We also ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer_  The shrimp cocktail appetizer was priced at _12_50 and we received 4 small_medium shrimp_  Strike three_  \n\nBefore the main dishes came, we were offered bread for our table_  1 piece each!  We weren't even offered the bread basket_  And the rolls tasted like they came from Safeway_  My guest's filet mignon entreee was very small in size and not cooked to order_  The side dishes that came with the entree had too much garlic and oil_  My entree was sadly much worse_  The fish portions, 4 small and thin fried pieces, were not only small but tasted as if they fried the portions from the frozen food section_  6 green grapes garnished the top of the fish_  At _25 for this entree, this entree made my top 5 overpriced entrees of all time_  I've had better fish meals at Long John Silver's_  We decided to skip the dessert after our main food experience_  \n\nIf you are looking for an overpriced restaurant with mediocre food quality and portions and an ambience that could be mistaken for a 1950s rest home, you have come to the right place_  Otherwise, you are much better off at newer restaurants in Scottsdale_Phoenix that offer a more vibrant atmosphere, higher quality food and generous portions, and friendly environment_",)("Had a special here the other night___Elk tenderloin with Huckleberry sauce, side of mashed potatos and the most wonderful sugar-snap peas you can imagine_ The fresh bread they bring first alone makes me want to come back_ I hear elk can be very gamey, and I don't know if it's just how Chef David prepared it, but it was unforgettably good (he recommends somewhere between rare and med-rare, which was perfect)_ Like I said, it was a special, it's worth calling them ahead to find out what's going on_ If Elk is there, just stop thinking and get in your car_ Husband had the duck_ Cripsy skin, tender and juicy inside, with perfect Orange sauce_ He almost cried_ I watched others order the Dover Sole, and it is really cool to watch the waiters come out with the cart and portable stove, bone the fish and warm it in the butter sauce right in front of you! I overheard them telling another table they are flown in from Holland every Monday_ I think the Dover Sole is a Monday specialty, in fact_ Yes, the decor looks original 1983, but hey___pretend you have a French grandma and you're having a formal dinner at her house_ There_ Now relax and enjoy a fine meal!",)("In the Phoenix area, my husband and I have  been to other french restaurants such as Sophies, and Coup Des Tartes_  Voltaire's is by far our favorite_  The service is impeccable and the food is delicious_  This restaurant food reminded me of my honeymoon in France_ The restuarant has been open for years and years_ That should speak volumes, as there are so many restaurants that don't make it and close_  You can also go to restaurant_com and get purchase a  discount coupon for eating here or you can go to the restaurants web site and get a buy one dinner get one free_  Worth trying out_",)("Not impressed, terrible experience_ \n\nMaitre D' was rude when we arrived\n\nThey don't take AMEX, the Maitre D' dropped the card on the table said _we don't take American Express_  and walked away_\n\nWhen we were leaving he didn't thank us for coming, instead he chased us out the door to question our tip even though it was close to 25%\n\nThe food was unimpressive_\n\nService was quick and friendly\n\nBuilding is cool but the atmosphere stinks_ \n\nDon't wast your cash, Folks_  If you want good French food go to Vincent's on Camelback or Zinc Bistro in Kierland_",)("Yes, this place is old school Scottsdale and no, the clientele is not the young and the hip_ Big deal_ If that makes you feel out of place, then by all means, visit someplace where you can see and be seen_ This is a nice little low-slung building, with an interior that says _My French grandmother decorated twenty years ago,_ but it works_ It's comfortable_ I bought a Groupon to Voltaire a while back and only afterward did I read the reviews on Yelp_ I had buyer's remorse_ I felt anxious about visiting_ Was I going to be the youngest in the dining room? Was the food going to be bland? Is the smell of Ben Gay going to ruin the wine? Was the Ma tre d' going to be rude? The answers are no, no, no, and kind of_\n\nLet me address the food, since that's the whole point of a restaurant_ It was great_ My wife and I both started with the onion soup_ It was excellent_ Not as much umami as you find in the onion soup and Zinc Bistro, but you know what? Zinc Bistro cheats and puts soy sauce in their onion soup_ This was excellent old school onion soup_ For entrees, I had the sweetbreads and my wife had the Filet Mignon with peppercorn sauce_ I'd never had sweetbreads, so I asked our waitress what she thought of them, and she was truthful, saying they were an acquired taste_ Well, it's safe to say that I've acquired a taste for calf thymus_ This was accompanied by corn, snap peas, and a dab of very creamy garlic mashed potatoes, all of which were very nice_ The vegetables were served modestly, with salt and butter and it works_ My wife's Filet was good_ I'm not a huge fan steak au poivre, but it was good_ I enjoyed my steak a bit more at Cafe Roka recently, but they're served with two completely different sauces_ For desert, my wife tried the creme brulee and reports that it was nice and light, and I had the ice cream with candied chestnuts_  This was super-sweet_ The flavor of the chestnuts was lost amongst the caramel sauce_ I can't believe I ate the whole thing_\n\nRegarding the age of the clientele, there was actually one couple present who were younger than us, but for the most part the crowd was made up of Boomers_ There was only one bona fide blue hair and I happened to notice our waitress lending an arm to assist this lady up from her table and out the front door -very thoughtful_ Dress code seems to be fairly casual (much to the Ma tre d's chagrin, I suspect)_ I thought I was going casual with chinos and an oxford, but there was a dude there with jeans and Birks_\n\nFinally, the Ma tre d'___ This guy___ what can I say about him_ He gave us a look up and down when we came in_  Well, my wife got the look anyway - I think I looked pretty good in my chinos and French blue oxford_  I wonder if the Boomer in jeans and Birks got the look, too?  The Ma tre d' was pleasant enough when we had to interact with him (he seats guests and apparently runs credit cards), but I just got this vibe from him that we were not living up to his expectations as guests_ Then the funniest thing happened (well, I'd had a couple of glasses of happiness, so it was funny at the time): when we got our credit card receipt back, he'd written in the tip for us!!!  It was as if he couldn't trust us to (a) leave a tip or (b) leave a tip on the full amount of the bill, not just the part remaining after the Groupon came off the top_\n\nI wouldn't let this guy spoil your evening - unless he chases you into the parking lot as per one previous review_  Even then you'll have something to tell your grandchildren_ The food is great here_ The ambiance is cozy_  The crowd might be a little geriatric, but you know what, so is your grandmother_  Just enjoy your time, and see if the Ma tre d' does anything funny and report it here_",)("First of all, if you like classic French food, this place is for you_ Prices are very reasonable and dishes are well-executed_ If you're in your 20s-30s, it's not a place to impress your date or friends - it's not trendy or slick_ Actually, to be honest, I don't really like this typical for many authentic French restaurants home style decor - it's too old fashioned for me and depressing___ \n\nIt was a Thanksgiving evening and  besides being Europeans (= New year is a bigger holiday for us than Christmas), we don't have any relatives in this area to celebrate this holiday with, so we called all restaurants which were opened on Thanksgiving and Voltaire was one of them_ Party of 3 - last minute reservation - no problem_\n\nWe liked food  a lot and if we were in our late 50s-60s-70s, we would go to this restaurant on a regular basis, but we're still too young to enjoy being there - the atmosphere in this restaurant kills my spirit and mood_  \n\nI was surprised to see a female waitress as French restaurants are known for hiring only male waiters, but we were there on a big holiday, so it wasn't a typical day and possibly their regular personnel didn't want to work_\n\nWould I go back? Probably, but not in the nearest future_ Would I recommend this place? Yes, you have to experience it yourself if you like authentic French cuisine _",)('This place is just ok - the smell once you walk in the door is not pleasing___very musty smelling_  The decor is extremely dated_  However, the food was pretty good and the service was average_  Not the best French place in town, by any stretch of the imagination!\n\nBeware___does not take American Express either - how strange for an expensive restaurant!',)("Service was good and attentive, but the food was decidedly average_\n\nMy soup (vichyssoise) was very good, the proper temperature and very well blended; my wife's French Onion was _ok__ \n\nFor entrees, my Orange Duck was good, but nothing special, with uncrisped skin_ My wife's garlic steak was ok, but the meat itself was bland although the garlic sauce was nice_ The included sides (a tiny dallop of acceptable mashed potatoes, a few snow peas, and very tasty butternut squash cubes) was far better than the extra side we shared: fingerling potatoes with truffel oil, which had an odd _mustardy_ flavor I really disliked_ \n\nDesert was the largest disappointment - my Peach Melba (admittedly ordered in December) was canned peaches (tasted exactly like Dole!) and off-the-shelf vanilla icecream and raspberry sauce_ My wife's profiterroles (cream puffs) were just as ordinary - the chocolate sauce was Hershey's according to my chocolate-addicted wife, with the same ordinary ice cream and _nothing special_ creampuffs_\n\nThe decor is typical retired Scottsdale 1970s: flowery wallpaper, cheap crystal chandeliers, _classic_ black-and-white waiter attire_ At 40, I think I was the youngest person there_\n \nFor the price, Vincent's on Camelback is light years better_ \nFor the decor, almost any place is better_",)("My Husband and I went to Voltaire last night for my bday, we enjoyed the atmosphere (French decor) and the jazz music playing in the background, we found it to be nice & romantic_ We ordered the french onion soup as an appetizer, and both of us thought that it was good_ We than ordered the orange duck & the peppercorn steak_, both items were good, not great_ Although we enjoyed it, we thought before we come back we'd want to try out other restaurants_",)('Tried this place with a restaurant_com offer & still thought it was overpriced and extremely subpar food_',)
