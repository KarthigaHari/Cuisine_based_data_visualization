("Fantastic!!!!!! Ia couple of weeks ago I ran into their name again and realized that they were at the Ahwatukee Farmers market (Sunday's)_  I  had seen them in central Phoenix but did not try them that day_   I tried Short Leash dogs that Day (fantastic also)_ \n\nSo___ I gambled and told my wife and son that I had a surprise for them_ Took them the the farmers market_ Grabbed a great cup of coffee at the market an then walked around the corner and found trucking!   AWESOME was the words out of the three of us_   Today is Saturday and also planning on getting up early to great another crepe tomorrow!  \n\nLocal entrepenuers, great food___ You must support!  You will not regret it!",)("I have a simple argument for why you should stop what you are doing right now and go find this food truck_\n\nDuck Fat Fries!\n\nYeah, I'm sure I can stop right there_  Game, set, match!  You lose the debate, but win the lottery in taste_\n\nYou need more convincing?  Blasphemy!!!  But okay, how about I blow your mind with a single word_\n\nNUTELLA!!!\n\nOh, hey I'll wait a minute so you can recover your senses_  That's right, low and behold they made nutella, banana, pecan filled crepes and it was good_  Damn good!  Push your mother over and step on her neck to get the last one good_\n\nMy sister introduced me to this food truck at which I hold worship every week_  And for this I owe her a kidney_  RUN! don't walk to this food truck_\n\nP_S_ - Tillamook cheese rules!  And if sweet isn't your thing because your mother smoked when she was pregnant_  Than they have you covered with their mouthwatering savory crepes too_",)("This review is as much about the food as it is about the owners_  Both Jeff and Erin, and the other people involved with this venture are some of the most passionate food people I have ever met_  The love of the food shows in the presentation, creativity and the tastiness of their creations_  \n\nTry a crepe, any of them, and know that what you are getting is the freshest, most authentic crepe experience in town_  But don't forget, they have other stars on the menu as well_  If they have any frites, try them, all three styles they are currently doing are awesome_  The french frozen custards are out of this world, where else can you get homemade brown butter or espresso bean custard that was developed by the guy in a truck!\n\nMy only wish is that I could have this every single day, it is one of the best reason to visit one of our local farmer's markets_\n\nGo for the experience and see how real love is put into food_",)("I just experienced my first crepe from TGF at the Scottsdale Farmer's Market this past weekend___I actually went to the Scottsdale FM SPECIFICALLY looking for TGF___I had seen something somewhere (?) about them and knew I had to try to find them_  And I'm glad I did! \n\nI got the nutella_banana_walnut crepe and it was awesome!  I wasn't sure what to get my first time and asked whether this was overly sweet___and I was advised that as long as I liked nutella I'd be ok_  They were right!  it was a perfect blend of nutella and bananas and walnuts were a great addition_  The crepe was so light and yummy_  I can't wait to go back and try some of the more savory crepes as well as the fries!  It's definitely a bit more on the pricey side (not overpriced because you definitely get what you pay for in this case! just more then say___you're average coffee and donut___it's worth the splurge!), but it's a lovely treat_  I'd definitely say skip starbucks and the scone or whatever and head to the FM for some fresh, good food!   I'll update my review (hopefully to five stars) when I try some of the savory food!  :)",)("This was my first food truck_ They were super nice, friendly and even gave me a tour of the truck_ \n\nThe duck fat fries were amazing, and everything I've eaten there has been great_",)("I agree with the other Yelpers in that Truckin Good Food is awesome!!  They bring such an authentic style crepe to the PHX area--something hard to find____ for a reasonable price too!!  I also had the sweet crepe with banana, vanilla pastry cream, and crushed meringue (I have never had anything with crushed meringue before and it was yummy!)  We also got the kimchee vegetarian crepe with cheese and shredded coconut  (what a crazy combo--I think I'll get another one today since I'll be volunteering at Tet today again--yay!)\n\nErin and Jeffrey are so sweet too--something very hard to come by these days :)",)("something i couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams - i drive 20 minutes, every sunday to delight in parisian-style street food in ahwatukee_  \n\nthe first _truckin_ crepe i ever tried is called _umami what_ which combines sesame and soy pickled cherry tomotes, fresh chevre, mushroom ragout wakame, fresh spinach and basil_  all i have to say is that it is SO TRUCKING GOOD i can't even try the other menu items yet!\n\nawesome_ awesome_ awesome_",)("Sooooo, I had heard great things about Truckin' Good Food, and did lots of research on them before going to the Scottsdale Farmer's Market to stalk them_  We made a special trip to go find this crepe truck, and I must say the crepes were delicious_  Unfortunately my issue is with the wait and the lack of ingredients_  \n\nThere wasn't anyone in front of us, so we walked right up to the window and ordered two crepes_ I ordered a nutella and banana crepe, except they didn't have any bananas, I was like that's fine___I'm here for a crepe, I will get one- so just plain nutella (but they didn't offer to reduce the price which sort of annoyed me)_  Then we ordered the other sweet crepe which was lemon curd_  Since there wasn't anyone there, we thought it would be quick, however they said it would be 20 minutes for the crepes to be ready_  I was shocked_  How can to have customers wait for 20 minutes for crepes when there aren't even people in line_  I couldn't imagine how long it would take it there were people in front of us_\n\nFinally, after getting the crepes and getting a chance to eat them, I was at least happy with the result_  The crepes were flavorful (even if they were missing banana) and thin_  I'd go back, but hope that they had figured out how to get crepes out faster_",)("I'm a huge fan of crepes_ I make them at home whenever I get a chance_ I must say, though, that Jeff takes the crepe to a whole new level for me and puts mine to shame_ The fillings are always awesome_ \n\nSadly, since the city won't let them do crepes right now, we must suffer without_ And yet, Jeff still comes through with other awesome creations_ I look forward to every Sunday and catching them at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market_ \n\nJeff & Erin - Keep on truckin!",)("Truckin' Good Food is by far my favorite part of the Ahwatukee Farmers Market!  So far, I have tried the Veggie crepe and the Bean and Cheese crepe and both were spectacular_  For various reasons, it had been about a month since I had been able to meet up with their tent on Sundays and today I got my fix!\n\nJeff and Erin are both so sincere and friendly, which makes it easy to hang out and chat while your crepe is made right in front of you_  The care and attention put into each and every order really makes TGF stand out from the rest, the fresh, quality ingredients don't hurt either!\n\nNext week, I've got to try the PB&J!!",)("Tried them at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market and love them!  I can't  for the next food adventure with them_",)("Addicted to duck fat fries!  Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries_  Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are?  You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries_  They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go_  Nope_  Don't go_ \n\nI guess I should mention the rest of the menu_  Everything is awesome_  Nutella rules!  Seriously_",)("I was so stoked for the Crepes and Craft beer event@ Hanratty's w_Truckin' Good Food, but I can't say I could 'rave' about any of it_ Our first course was chips w_something, something duck fat_ Love the duck fat dip, but again, it was just potato chips_ Second course, sausage and potatoes-yum_ Here again, I felt let down_ The potatoes reminded me of instant w_ a single piece of kale placed on top_ Yes, single_ To finish, Crep  Suzette, good but not astounding_ I'm afraid I had my hopes too high-I don't even remember all the snazzy details_ I'd like to try their real food, maybe the fantastic other crepes I hear about_ Maybe just because it was an event I wasn't so blown away? I'll def give them another shot when I get a chance_ Sorry_ :(",)("Delicious crepes! I love that they're obviously just a little independent group - I get a crepe almost every Sunday at the Farmer's Market_ It can be a bit of a wait but worth it!",)("Yum! Crepes are delicious! I had the special with Brie and apples_ Pommes frites were super tasty as well! Don't miss if you go to the Ahwatukee Farmers Market_",)('Found these two (thanks to twitter) at the Tet Festival in Mesa_ I tried the banana, mango, vanilla cream and crushed meringue crepe_ It was unbelievable_ Fantastic flavor and texture on a perfectly made crepe_ \n\nDelicious food from a sweet couple__ I will be watching their twitter feed tor more locations (hopefully soon!)_\n\nYum!',)("At this point, I've had three of the four crepe selections, with the Veg being the only one I haven't tried_ The verdict is that they are fantastic_\n\nWith choices both sweet and savory, the real winner remains the My First Time, a collection of Nutella, Bananas, and Walnuts in warm fresh crepe_ This is an amazing piece of food_ \n\nNow, in addition to all of the delicious delicious crepes, there are fries_ And the fries are SO good_ Made with Duck Fat, these are exquisite bits of fried potato_ Combined with homemade dipping sauces, they just can't be beat_ Check them out at Farmer's Markets around town_ Go get some! They're delish! :)\n\nCheck out more pics and a longer review at http:__rapunxelle_wordpress_com_",)("Until I ordered from Truckin' Good Food, I was a crepe virgin_  So fittingly, my first crepe was called _My First Time__  My First Time also became my second time___just so you know_\n\nI love the nutella and I love bananas, and at first, that's all I wanted in my crepe_  Jeff persuaded me to get it with walnuts as well_  I'm glad I did_  It was delish!\n\nTruckin' Good Food is awesome_  I look forward to trying other crepes and seeing them around in their new truck_",)("It started as a low vibration in my mouth_\n\nThen it became a little more of a low-volume Hum_\n\nThen my teeth started rattling, just a little bit_\n\nI went and looked in the mirror into my opened mouth, and it hit me as to what was happening_\n\nMy taste buds were_____what?_____chanting______????\n\nAll I heard was tiny little echo of  _We Are Not Worthy_____We Are Not Worthy_ over and over again, building to a crescendo, then stopping abruptly_ \n\nThen they took a low bow_\n\nThis was right after eating the Mardi-Gras-inspired Comte ~ ham ~ celery root r moulade cr pe from TGF today_\n\nIt was seriously one of the best things to ever cross my taste buds_\n\nThis truck is worthy of the hype_  Some aren't - but this one IS_\n\nI've still yet to get a taste of the duck fat fries - went too early once, and this time I was too late as they were sold out_  Darnedest luck_\n\nGo out of your way to visit these nice folks and their other-worldly cr pes_  You will not be disappointed_",)
