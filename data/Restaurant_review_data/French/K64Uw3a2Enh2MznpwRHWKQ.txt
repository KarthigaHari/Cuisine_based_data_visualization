Aside from that - a really fantastic range of well executed meat dishes: from rack of lamb to braised short ribs and steak Helene (sliced thin and served with truffle laced bordeaux sauce and bernaise on the side)_ The wine list was comprehensive and included a range of little known wines from New Zealand and Washington to all the big California players_ It would garner 5 stars if we didn't have to keep asking for our waiter and if the place was vented a little better_ Other than that, the food was great and the other service staff (hostess, bus boys, other wait staff) seemed to be totally on top of it_",)("Razz's is among my favorite places in the Valley_ The food is impeccable, the wine list superb_ I can't pick a favorite item, though I'm a sucker for the short ribs_ FYI, I know Razz can do terrific vegetarian entrees, and according to the menu, they will create one for you on request_ Razz's catered my wedding, and even I, a devout omnivore, opted for the meatless dish_ Three years later, people still talk about the food at our wedding_",)('Hands down best food in the valley_ Beggers pouch is a must have!
