Bonus points for having soy milk available_ Coffee was actually way above average for drip coffee_ \n\nWhen we ordered our food, we both wanted croissants instead of the baguette that was supposed to come with our meals, which it says on the menu is an option_ The waitress informed us that the croissants were in the process of baking and it would be  a bit longer than usual for our food to be ready if we wanted croissants_ That would be fine with us, we said_ Sadly, she came back about 10 minutes later to let us know the croissants burned, so we wouldn't be getting any :( She was really nice about it though, and after trying the baguette_whatever kind of crusty white bread it is they serve, I forgot all about the croissant that could have been_\n\nBf ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was not advertised as coming with sides, but it indeed came with hash browns AND a side salad, and was half the price of my meal (it was only around _6!)_ Mine included pretty much everything his did, just deconstructed-bacon, eggs, hash browns, bread, but with jam and without a salad_ Those were basically the only differences_ Mine also came with coffee (though oj was stated on the menu as being available, I just didn't ask for it), but I certainly don't think that was worth the extra six bucks when I could get all I wanted for half the price in the bfast sandwich!\n\nThe one thing that reallyyyyy bothered me about my meal, though, was that there was ROSEMARY on everything-on the hash browns and on the eggs (which were stacked on top of one another)_ This would have been ok if it was stated on the menu, but rosemary is nowhere to be found in any description I read_ It was also all over bf's food, but he likes it, so he didn't care_ I have a serious aversion to it after an unfortunate food poisoning incident a few years ago, and noticed it immediately when my plate was set in front of me_ I would have picked around it, but it was seriously everywhere_ \n\nThe waitress was incredibly nice about it and didn't really press for questions about why I couldn't eat it, but swiftly took it away and said I would have a fresh, non-rosemary version of my breakfast shortly_ I really appreciated that, a lot_ A chef brought out my rosemary-free food just a few minutes later, and as a bonus, they gave me a croissant!!! They had just come out of the oven and I really liked that they remembered I'd tried to order it with that, and it was delicious_\n\nOverall, great service and inexpensive food in a lovely atmosphere!
