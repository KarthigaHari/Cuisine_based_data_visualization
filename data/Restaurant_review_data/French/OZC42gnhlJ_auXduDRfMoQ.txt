("Wow!  Just happened upon this place this afternoon, and am more than a little bit surprised at what a great experience we had here today_  The ambiance is brilliant--very open and minimalist, with music at a pleasant, unobtrusive volume_  The weather today was gorgeous, and they had the door open to allow in the cool breeze_  At least three waitstaff approached my girlfriend and I, checking in with us regarding what we would like off of the menu_  We ordered two sandwiches, the Salmon on the baguette (delicious homemade, flaky bread!) and the Seared Tuna and Avocado on the Ezekiel bread; both came with side salads_  The sandwiches were delicious, albeit the Salmon was light on the actual salmon, which I was a bit disappointed by_  In all, though, the ingredients were fresh and not too heavy_ I got a refreshing iced coffee for _2_50 with free(!) refills_ \n      A man who I believe to be the owner hung out with us and talked to us about his time in France, and gave us some madeleines on the house, which are made fresh here--they were delicious___a hint of lemon or citrus zest!  He also encouraged us to try the Lucky Buddah beer, infused with essence of violet and light blackberry flavoring--it was awesome! The additives did not sweeten the beer, merely augmented it_  Finally, as we transitioned into some Sunday work on the wifi, we tried some of the pastries for dessert____I had the hazlenut_milk chocolate_ganache dome pastry, and my girlfriend had the blackberry tart with a rum base_  Utterly delicious--the dome tastes like a larger, lighter version of a Ferrero Roche_  To top it all off, contrary to their website's posted hours, they are open until 10 pm on a Sunday!!  AWESOME_\n     Suffice it to say we had a beautiful, romantic Sunday afternoon and evening here, absolutely enhanced by the attentive and congenial staff_ I've seen some comments about previous experiences from others who have visited Scratch that mentioned a _chaotic,_ or _disorganized,_ staff--I do notice that they are less conventional in that so many waitstaff approached our table to check on us, which I find to be different from what I am used to, but pleasant nevertheless!  To me it shows that they are collectively invested in ensuring that their customers are being attended to_  I am so excited to see Scratch as an addition to the Downtown Phoenix restaurant and bar scene; definitely one of my favorites thus far!!",)("Scratch is still very new, so I'm looking forward to a lot of changes for the better_  They've got a great location, and the owner seems to have the enthusiasm for success_\n\nOur first attempt at scratch was kind of a disaster_  We had quite a large group and were there within their first month open, so it was almost to be expected_  However we were assured they could handle our group so we gave it a shot_  The service was slow at best_  Our waitress didn't seem to know how to handle a large table and made it a point to tell us that many, many times_  She made us feel like a burden, but reminded us that she had 20 years experience (so I'm not sure what the problem was)_  We were later visited by the owner, and I believe some friends who didn't even work there who he called in to help - bonus points_  Still, after being told we couldn't order anything beside basic drinks (because the bartender _probably won't know how to make them), we waited forever for water, beer, and eventually food_  I can't vouch for anyone else because frankly I wasn't paying attention, but my veggie burger seemed like something from the Sysco truck_  Not impressed_\n\nTry #2: Brunch_  Service was still slow and confused, but much better_  The Eggs Royale were commendable - their salmon has a uniquely mild and delicious flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly_  I was looking forward to trying one of their pastries, but was disappointed with the selection_  The pastry case looked bored_  With only about 3 different choices, the pastries looked good but unimpressive for bakery standards_  They had a selection of macaroons, which although likely fresh, seemed a bit pricey at _3_75 each_  I ended up skipping the pastries_\n\nLastly, and most notably, the place lacks personality_  There's something about the newly renovated complex Scratch lives in that makes it a fun place to go, but the atmosphere ends at the gate_",)("Great location, great atmosphere, great patio_ I had a goat cheese and mushroom crepe- it was delicious and the coffee was great too_ The service was seriously lacking though- the waitress was crazy flustered, it's coffee and crepes___ Calm down_ The coffee bar gal ended up serving us and though she was better, we had to ask for all of the items we ordered, coffee refills, etc_ It's newly opened so I am hoping to revise this review after they get it together_",)("Patio, Patio, Patio!  \n\nSpring time is a wonderful time to eat outside and this renovated building is definitely a new draw on Roosevelt Row in the Evans Churchill neighborhood_  The outdoor patio is shooting for French Quarter in the middle of the southwest_  It is adjacent to two other restaurants opening up soon_  There were an abundance of people rolling up to take advantage of all the bicycle parking_ (***Main parking is accessed off the alley, which runs east-west between 3rd St and 5th St***)\n\nThe interior is very contemporary with an open kitchen concept and clean lines_  There is a cozy bar along the west wall with plenty of local on tap_  There will also be a walk-up baked goods counter and I'm told there will be ice cream!\n\nGiven the vogue of many restaurants recently___they went with a soft opening and still seem to be working out the kinks_  The staff is still learning their sections and the intricacies of the menu_\n\nAs for the  food, it's a solid 3_5 stars, went with the Lamb Burger which was well seasoned, topped with fresh mint leaves on their own freshly baked bun___this come standard with a mixed greens side salad_  Also tried the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich that was well seasoned on two grilled pieces of bread, with sliced cucumber and avocado_\n\nIt's a balanced price point of _8-10_sandwich with a great outside ambiance_  The menu has a wide variety to choose from breakfast, sandwiches, and soon to be great pastries_\n\nA slow opening would not stop me from going back given all the great reviews of the original location_  I'm sure management will dot the I's and cross the T's soon enough_\n\nBon appetit!",)("I've been here four times now; three times for lunch and once for drinks and dessert_  First, the service is a bit hit or miss_  I've had a couple of really attentive servers, and one who was just awful_  Patio service has been less consistent than the times I've dined inside_  That said, it's still a new place, and I'm hoping they're working out staffing kinks_\n\nThe food has not disappointed_  I've had the seared tuna sandwich, the croque monsieur (with egg) and the Angus burger with mozzarella_  Of the three, the tuna sandwich was my favorite_  The tuna was delicately seasoned, and paired well with the pesto and cucumber_  The burger was delicious_  The croque monsieur was decent, but nothing to write home about_  Also, the egg was not cooked through, so the white was runny, which I hate_  With the exception of the lunch I had on the patio (which had terrible service), I was in and out in under an hour_ \n\nI went there with friends on a Friday night for drinks and dessert_  We didn't realize the restaurant had a dessert tray of the pastries being sold next door, so we ordered pastries at the pastry shop, and took them to the patio to sit and order drinks_  The pastries were all very good, but very sweet_  There were four pastries being shared by six people, and we had a very hard time finishing any of them_  As if we didn't have enough sugar on the table, the owner brought over two creme brulees, which were really good_  Of all of the sweets on the table, the creme brulees disappeared the fastest_  They were regular creme brulees, but the owner said that he planned to change the flavor each week, with orange and earl grey coming in the next two weeks_  The organic wine we ordered was not great, but they did have some decent bottle offerings, we just chose incorrectly_  They have a pretty solid draft beer menu_\n\nOverall, I really like this place, and am eager to go back for brunch_  The food has been consistently good, and I think as they get a bit more into the swing of things, the servers will get better and the kitchen a bit faster_  It's nice to have something happening on that corner, and I like that they're open late enough than you can swing by for a quick bite or dessert after an earlier event_",)('One of the nicer breakfast places to check out_ Go there for Mimosas and crepes!',)("I live in the neighborhood & couldn't wait for Scratch to open_  Decor is tr s chic_  I would give my rating four stars but the service needs some extra training (server should know what a b chamel sauce \nis if working in a French restaurant) & a bit more personality & interest_ Food is served promptly but it's the initial service that's the first impression_  I love living downtown & happy to see more businesses popping up_ I want them to be successful_ I will be back though_ I'm not ready to give up_",)("While out with a girl friend and her parents doing the First Friday thing, we happened across Scratch's newest location in downtown Phoenix_ I've been to Scratch in Scottsdale and was pleasantly surprised to discover their newest location_ \n\nLet's get a few things out of the way___\n\nIt was a First Friday_ \nThey just opened two weeks prior___\nThe space is at least 3x larger than their original location___\nAnd___pretty much all new waitstaff_\n\nOkay, back to the review_ \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant during peak First Friday craziness, and was promptly seated on the patio (as requested)_ Due to it being FF, they were only serving a limited menu of burgers_ After a quick peruse of the menu, we quickly found a burger to suit all our tastes (Lamb, crab, beef)_ We were ready to place our order, and then we waited_____\n\nAnd waited____until we flagged down the hostess and asked her to find our server_ \n\nThis is where the review could go south for most restaurants, but I give the team at Scratch a lot of credit for how they turned this experience around_ The friendly hostess, our lovely bartender, the owner, and an assortment of other staff went out of their way to ensure the remainder of our experience there lived up to our expectations_ And it did!! \n\nSure, there were some newby mis-steps, but on the whole, the food is well-prepared, the desserts are interesting and yummy (not to mention the awesome presentation!), and most of all, the staff is friendly and engaging_ \n\nIt's a cool spot, great location, and there is so much potential here_ We will definitely be back!",)("The food at Scratch is sooooo good! From apps to salads to entrees to desserts, everything is amazing_ (I don't understand how salad dressing can be so incredibly delicious, but it is_) The wine selection is small, but all of the offerings are top-notch, which actually makes it easier to choose; rather than being overwhelmed by an enormous wine list, you can zero in on what you're in the mood for, and be assured that it will be fantastic_ The atmosphere is casual and friendly - a bright space that works for girls' get-togethers, a romantic meal out, or just a quick lunch_ Duc and the rest of his staff are incredibly gracious hosts - you can tell that they are genuinely invested in making sure you enjoy your food and your experience_ I highly recommend Scratch - make sure you go hungry and save room for dessert!",)("Well, not so good___My sister and I went for dinner before a show_  So happy to see this restaurant on Roosevelt Row___so sad to taste the food!  She had a salad that looked like it came from a bag except for a bit of tofu___tasteless, and I had the french onion soup, again tasteless_  I should have sent it back, but I so wanted the place to be good and I was hoping the entree would save them_  Not so much___we split the shrimp in alfredo sauce with whole grain noodles_  The whole thing looked brown and oozy_  By this time we were just sad for them_  The chef came over and asked about the food___we told him about the onion soup and he said yes he knew, and blamed it on his assistant_  No apology, nothing_\n\nMy suggestion about Scratch___don't go till they clean up their act_  Oh by the way, Sat_ night @ 6:00 -7:30, one waiter!",)("Amazing! I'm already a repeat customer! I am in love with the breakfast! If they take as much care with their lunch and dinner as they do their breakfast than the price and your time is worth it to try out ALL their food!! Seriously their breakfast is divine and well priced!",)("Service was extremely slow and the breakfast dish was not cooked properly_  I've been twice and am not going back_",)("How do I describe___ not bad, not enough to cause a craving___but the reason for the two stars is the absolute incompetence of whoever was preparing the dishes_ Literally (not figuratively) 1_4 of what was listed on the menu was not on the plate_ It went kind of like this___\nMe: I'll have the chef's special\nServer: Ok sure I will return with that\nCook: Yea___I don't feel like making all of that \nServer: OK, just give me what you've got back there and I'll give it to him :)\nThis is not an exaggeration___\nI am one who is more than excited to see the new growth in downtown phoenix, but am sincerely almost over the idea that _Just showing up_ gets you the award_ \nIf I showed up at a car dealership and said I wanted a new mini cooper and I gave you the cash for it, then you say I changed my mind here is a dodge station wagon I would laugh you right out of business___SAME PRINCIPAL, at least offer to discount my check or something after realizing your error_\nI hope these guys get it together quickly cause summer is right around the corner_",)("I really like this place_  So, why only 3 stars - service_  The food is extremely good_  The Bison burger was sincerely incredible_  Omelet in black truffle sauce - wow!!  Very good coffee_  But, the service is inconsistent_  First time - excellent_  Second time, slow____almost as if they did not have enough help_  They're getting started in this location, and I hope they get this issue fixed because otherwise its a 5 star experience_  I'll be back - often - and I'm sure its going to get better_",)("Went there yesterday for lunch, with very low expectations for service based on previous reviews_ I have to say that this was not even REMOTELY the case for me_ \n\nI sat on the patio which was absolutely lovely_ The service was incredibly prompt, and sensitive to the fact that I had less than an hour for lunch (including transit!)_ Our waitress was very friendly and split my friend and my check with absolutely no problem_\n\nI had the cold smoked salmon sandwich which had avocado, cucumber and dill_ It was delicious, and, I think, a pretty healthy option! The side salad with balsamic vinaigrette that came with the sandwich was equally as delicious_ This was all for _7_25-- unbelievable_ \n\nTheir happy hour is 3-6, and I will definitely be back to check it out_ I'm so excited to have a fun, new, and different option for lunch close to downtown_",)("Went to try it today at lunch and it wasn't open_  Went to Carly's Bistro instead (fantastic!)_  Called the number for Scratch when I got back to the office and it was disconnected_  Guess it's closed?",)("Based on 2 breakfast visits I must say that I am a fan! Great coffee delicious omelets and fresh salads_ Love the outdoor shaded patio_ Only improvement I see is that the bike racks need lower loops down the post to accommodate using u-locks for shorter bikes like my Brompton and my wife's folding bike_",)("The hot chocolate at Scratch in Scottsdale is to die for - so, I have been not so patiently waiting for Scratch to open up a mile from my house_  I went on their soft opening to order my beloved hot chocolate and they said they didn't have the chocolate ganache at that location yet but to try back in a few days_  Okay, no worries, it was their SOFT opening_ I understood and went back to eagerly waiting_ \n\nAbout 2 - 3 weeks after my original visit, I went back to finally get some of this Parisian hot chocolate!  We sat down outside and ordered french fries, a latte for my man, and my hot chocolate_  The latte came_  The water came_  The fries came_  The hot chocolate never came - now, I was being patient because I know this takes about 5 - 10 minutes to make at their Scottsdale location_  When I inquired with the waiter, it was obvious he had forgotten it and came back 5 minutes later explaining the CAFE did not serve the hot chocolate - but the PASTRY SHOP did_  The pastry shop downtown was not open yet and no one in the CAFE knew how to make it_  Then why the hell (pardon my French) is hot chocolate listed on 2 different menus for the cafe?!   I felt like the whole visit was a waste because we would not have ordered the watered-down latte or fries if we were informed about hot chocolate at the beginning - after all, we were really only there for that_ \n\nI'm about to give up on this place and fly to Paris_\n\nEDIT (04_04):  I was walking the dog around the neighborhood and noticed the PASTRY SHOP was open_  I asked for a hot chocolate_  And, get this, no one there knew how to the work the machine to make it_ Ahhhhh!!!",)("Here are a few things to consider before you dine at a restaurant named Scratch:\nQuite possibly you will be eating something made from scratch, which may take a little longer to prepare than the average restaurant_\nYou will have an opportunity to enjoy the freshest, in season quality ingredients_\nYou will be able to have handmade, fresh baked, painstakingly prepared French croissants in the morning and in the evening a tray of beautifully detailed French desserts will arrive table side for you to select from___there were 13 different options on a recent visit_  \n\nI think Scratch is best enjoyed when you are not in a hurry, and perhaps not (yet) on nights when there is a mob scene, though I think they will master that in time_ Lovely patio dining options (with great people watching) to enjoy before the heat comes_  Staff who are clearly friendly, attentive and take great pride in quality ingredients, cooking and service when the place is not slammed_  They mentioned on a recent visit that they are working on expanding their vegetarian and vegan offerings, so stay tuned for that_  Impeccably brewed, flavorful French teas_  Murals by local artists on the streetside planters, a parklike promenade and great ambience_  I love that they are open from 8 am - 10 pm weekdays and until 2 am on weekends_  That is ambitious for downtown Phoenix and deserves our support until they work out some of the details mentioned in other reviews_ \nSo here is my advice on Scratch_  Put yourself in a leisurely frame of mind, go on over there on a weeknight when you  can have the staff's undivided attention and I think you will be charmed with what Scratch is offering_  KJ the chef is a wizard  from what I have tasted so far, I plan to be back again and again to this cozy neighborhood gathering place_",)("I had a great time___ love the place, love the space, love that they have invested in downtown and believe that everyone should be as constructive as possible in writing a review___ a 1-star review should usually mean you got food poisoning and were robbed and yelled at by staff___ a 2-star review means you got an upset stomach and were rudely treated with no respect___ a 3-star review is average, a 4-star review very good, and a 5-star review is a wonderful experience_  My experience was 5-stars___ I was offered tastes of small, freshly baked items that had just come out of the oven, from the chef_owner who is a true Parisian from the 3rd arrondissement___ the breakfast is excellent, lunch great, desserts out of this world___ I think you're going to see some wonderful things happen here_  Heck, if he could make it in central Paris, I think he can make it here___  \n\noh, and before I knew the chef was from Paris, my friend ordered an omelette and when it came out, it reminded me of an omelette I had at the Crillon in Paris___ sounds weird, but a omelette in France is just somehow different, doesn't look like it came out of a cookie-cutter, looked like an egg cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing_  paired with their great coffee and a croissant____ simple perfection_\n\nthank you for being part of the neighborhood!",)("Let me start this review by saying that I hope to come back and give them more stars next time_\nThe good - the menu is really creative and brings a bit of sophistication to the Downtown salad and sandwich scene_  Also, the place is cool and airy, hip and comfy_  \n  \nThe bad - we had some service issues_  After being very attentive when we arrived, our waitress forgot that we were on a 45 minute lunch break and left us to languish  (and left our finished burger sitting on the counter staring at us for over 5 minutes)_  \n\nThe cooks forgot to make our second sandwich and fries, and when the waitress went to check on it, the cooks got into a fight that we could hear in the dining room, and one of the cooks stormed out_  We did eventually get fries (albeit not the ones we ordered), but ended up having to get the sandwich to go (b_c we'd already finished sharing the the burger and had to leave to get back to work)_  While the burger was fantastic (Wagyu beef with sauteed mushrooms - yum), and the fries were tasty and crispy, the grilled cheese was just a slice of cheddar on some toast (maybe there was a mistake and we got the kiddie version????)_\n\nOKAY, so I'm sure you are wondering why I gave them 3 stars and will ever go again _ _ _ because, despite the snafus, the food we did get was really good and the waitress bent over backwards to _make it right__  She apologized and kept us informed, she comped some of our food, etc_  So, in the end, she saved us as customers_",)("I am going to update this review, because it really wasn't worth 4 stars simply for the good location and cool remodel_ Truthfully, the food was bad and the service was bad, because there was only one waiter in the whole place_ He was doing his best but it just wasn't enough_ AND they ran out of croissants_ What french place runs out of croissants? I'm still a little upset about it a week later_",)('Ate here while on a visit back to PHX and glad to see this corner of 3rd st and Roosevelt getting a face lift_   Very open_comfortable space with good coffee and food_',)('This place is closed_ They filed for bankruptcy_ \nhttp:__blogs_phoenixnewtimes_com_bella_2013_06_scratch_pastries_phoenix_scottsdale_closes_php',)
