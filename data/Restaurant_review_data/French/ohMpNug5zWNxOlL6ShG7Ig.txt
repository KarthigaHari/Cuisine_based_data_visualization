No kids menu, so we ordered our daughter the sloppy joe and dared to ask them to put cheese on it_ The waiter made some rude remark about it, but agreed to add it_ When it came, there was no cheese_ The quiche was too salty to eat & the turkey salad was soaked in dressing & tasteless with soggy sweet potatoes piled on it_ So gross_ Between the bad food and the even more terrible service we were happy we had the truffle fries_ We won't be back_",)("_Food was delish_ Definitely order frites, yum!

Don't go if in a hurry meant to be enjoyed__",)("I have been here a dozen times for lunch, but only tried 2 things on the menu_ Reason being, I am usually driven to go to this out of way place based on my cravings for these amazing meals_ The salmon blt and the bacon burger_ When these are properly prepared, which they are about 80% of the time, they are amazing_ I would rank the burger tops in AZ! First bite you get a flavor rush of pork and beef, perfect! But, a few times I ordered this and it was dry and below average_ The preparation and cooking are crucial to this meal! Same goes for the salmon blt, perfect when properly prepped, but a disaster when overcooked_ Hopefully management stays on top of this! Fries have always been spot on for me, would rank these best in AZ too! As a side note, I was there once when Kevin Binkley showed up, the entire staff perked up and when into super Mario mode, this was the best meal I had there to date_ Amazing how this works! He should pay a lookalike to hang out there!!  Again 5-stars based on the meal when it's at its best!, if you get a sub-par meal the 1st time, try it again because when it's right it's a memorable meal!",)("After driving by Cafe Bink on numerous occasions and noticing the lovely outdoor patio was packed, we decided to give it a try for dinner with some friends and family_  It was a beautiful day in North Scottsdale so we made reservations for a group of five (they don't take reservations for parties of 4 or less), and thought patio seating would be awesome_ When we arrived that evening, the weather was cold, but we were assured that we would be cozy on the patio with the propane heaters, and they provided blankets to boot!  \n\nOur server was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and helped steer us to the special of the day, a veal tortellini, and numerous other dishes_  We ordered a large order of fries for the table, which came with three sauces_  The fries were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside_  While I munched on a few with no sauce (they didn't need any), the consensus at the table was that the truffle ketchup was extraordinary_  \n\nI was excited to try the French Onion soup, one of my faves when done properly _ _ _ and it was a good night for soup on the patio!  It was delicious _ _ _ the onions sweet and the broth smooth_  The crouton was just enough to hold up the cheese_  I loved it so much, I could have ordered another for my entree!  Because we couldn't make up our minds, my step-daughter and I shared two different entrees - Bolognese with Creamy Polenta, and the Catfish_ The Bolognese was hearty and complemented the smooth texture of the polenta_  The Catfish was perfectly cooked and accompanied by crunchy hush puppies_  \n\nUnfortunately, when food gets cold, it's not pleasant for anyone, and that evening was not the night to be dining al fresco on their patio_  Shortly into the meal, the propane tanks by our table were empty, and there was no replacement_ In Cafe Bink's defense, I will say they were gracious and moved us inside when a table freed up, and comped us dessert for our trouble_  Also, we brought home doggie bags of my entrees and heated them up the next night, and even my husband agreed that having it hot made a huge difference!  \n\nWe will certainly give Cafe Bink another try, but we will sit inside on the chilly evenings_",)("I don't get it___ how do so many people actually like this place?

The Salmon BLT is divine, and truffle ketchup should be in every pantry_ The one dish I loathed was Amy's Bolognese, which had a dry, mealy, overcooked texture, and tasted as if they'd knocked the salt container into it_ Service is always excellent, and the banana dessert is to kill for_",)("Don't order the calamari_  They were soaked in grease on the plate and when I showed the server, they took them back and put them on another plate grease and all_  My husband loves the Sloppy Joe_",)('Second time I visited the restaurant and guaranteed to be my last_  A very _underwhelming_ dining experience_  Poor service (waited at least 15 minutes before we saw a waiter), an equally bad meritage glass of wine, perhaps the worst prepared sand dabs I have ever had and a bill of _80_  And the place was packed!!

It was LOADED with anchovies_  We like anchovies, but this was just overkill_  Needless to say, my _17_00 Caesar Salad ended up in the trash_   How disappointing_  Would I go back?  No_  I always wanted to try Binkley's too, but after this experience, I think I may pass on that as well_  I am glad other people have liked Caf  Bink; it just was not for me_",)("I live in the desert ridge area so this is a fast beautiful drive that takes about 15 minutes_ We arrived on a Saturday and there was a little farmers marker in the parking lot_ We arrived right when they opened and were excited for our boozy lunch! \n\nRight when we walked up the manager, he had the door opened and ready to great us_ The tables are very close to each other so we opted for the empty bar counter_ I liked this too because you can spy into the kitchen_ We were instantly greeted by the bar tender and let the momos (mimosas) flow!
