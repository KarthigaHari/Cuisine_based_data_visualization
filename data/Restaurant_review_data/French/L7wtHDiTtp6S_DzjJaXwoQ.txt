('ORDER THE BACON! It was the highlight of the meal_ Oh and the very strong coffee was amazing if you like french style coffee_ So the buckwheat crepes were not what I expected_ They were good, but the hash browns were cold_ The french toast was good but not remarkable_ I will be going back for the coffee and the dessert crepes and to try the croque madame, but overall I would have been happier ordering the fresh fruit and chocolate croissant_',)('Since moving to Fountain Hills 2 years ago, we have been constantly on the search for a good restaurant right here in town, but have not found one yet_ Last week we had lunch at the Boulevard Cafe_ The menu looked quite tasty_ My husband ordered the quiche, I had the Nicoise_ His quiche was cheesy and oily, not fluffy at all_ The bread was stale_ My Nicoise was OK, but they used yucky cheap canned olives_ How hard can it be to use some nice cured olives??? Our waiter never asked if we needed a soda refill (the place was not crowded, yet he never came around)\nWe will try the place again to give it second chance_',)("Fantastic onion soup!  Rich flavor lots of onions simmered all day, and just the right amout of what must be gruyere (sp?)_  Anyway- worth it for that_  I have had the mussles and they are good_  Chicken was bon, but, then again, it is just roasted chicken_  I wish they would get together with the new French bakery for their bread!  Bread at Boulevard- 'eh; bread at bakery- c'est magnifique!  Overall, though this place is a gem in FH_",)("This is a fun little bistro that let's you bring your own wine_ My Dad lives in FH and it is a frequent stop for us when I am in town_ If this was in NYC or LA I'd give it 3 stars, but for metro Phoenix is deserves 4 stars because there are SO many chain restaurants here in AZ_ Therefore, when you find a privately owned place that serves good food with the personal touch I am always a fan!",)
