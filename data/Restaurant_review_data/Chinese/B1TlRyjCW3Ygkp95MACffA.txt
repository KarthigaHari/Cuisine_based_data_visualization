("A little bit of whole in the wall but the food was good! Plus, there wasn't wait like the other Vietnamese restaurant up the road_",)("Rad! I saw that the name changed to _Que Huong__ This is the same location as Maxim restaurant_ We just ate at the new Que Huong for the first time today___ Apparently they have a new owner but the same great food (I was worried that I lost one of my favorite local restaurants)_ They cleaned up the look a little bit and changed the menu a little bit_ I'm happy_ We had the spring rolls with Tofu: outstanding_ We also had spicy pho with vermicelli noodles and beef: Great_ The standard meatball pho was great as usual and we had lemon chicken_ That's right people! Listen up! While this is a Vietnamese restaurant, their Chinese food seems to be better than any Chinese food restaurant within 15 miles! If you don't want a standard Vietnamese dish and are hungry for Chinese come to Que Huong_ I have had about 15 - 20 Vietnamese dishes here (when it was Maxim) and have never had food that I was not happy about_ This place is great for take out as well_ Thumbs up!",)("I enjoyed having their big combo Pho plus a plate of fried Chinese-style (their description) dimsum with vegetables inside one weeknight dinner time_ It's a medium size place, where it seems to me that many regulars come in whenever they are open_ Very good service, including a young lady who speaks both English and Spanish_",)('Great pho! Previously Maxim on 19th, this place is always delicious and has friendly, good service_',)("So glad to see that this reincarnation of Maxim continues the practice of serving really tasty inexpensive fare with smother-you-with-friendliness service, and with a brighter and tidier dining area this time around_ The beef pho I tried is a superior bowl of piping hot goodness - very fresh flavors and they don't skimp on the meat_ The broken rice with grilled pork that I enjoyed on another visit made for a very satisfying meal_ The garlic chive dumplings are a must-try appetizer; these are a great alternative to the egg rolls or spring rolls that people usually order for starters_ This is the place to come to for delicious, hearty Vietnamese or Chinese meals on a budget_",)
