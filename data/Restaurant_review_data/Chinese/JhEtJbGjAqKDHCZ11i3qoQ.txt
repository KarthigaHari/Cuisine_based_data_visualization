With this method even after stuffing yourself you should have enough leftovers for rougly 3 more meals_",)("Sorry folks, but this place is terrible_  I had heard my friends raving about it for awhile, but finally had the, uh, _opportunity_ to try it out myself_\n\nWhen I first walked in, I noticed it was just _9 for a big bowl, far cheaper than what I'm used to paying at Genghis Grill_  Sounds good, right?\n\nWell, when I got to the food selections, I noticed a few things_  First, the meat was frozen_ Second, there are only four meat options (frozen chicken, frozen beef, frozen turkey, and frozen pork)_  Third, the vegetable selection is limited_  You'll have your lettuce, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, and bean sprouts, but there's not much more_  No eggs, baby corn, or anything else that might be interesting_  Oh, and no dry seasonings_\n\nThe sauces were encouraging_  I liked the idea of mixing and matching the different components_  After I tasted my food, however, backtracked on the sauce_  My bowl was quite soupy, but very bland_  The sauces have almost no flavor whatsoever_  Now I know why they provide that hot mustard___ You need it if you want to actually taste something_\n\nThe portions were great, but I didn't even finish mine because it was just a bland, soupy mess of frozen garbage_  I think I'll spend the few extra bucks on Genghis_",)("First time going here_ It was a nice experience making your bowl is pretty much a balancing act, but the veggies weren't cooked all the way although the noodles and sauce were pretty hot_ I enjoy the unlimited rice, soup and drinks_ The staff were very nice and helpful_",)("I live in Northern Virginia and whenever I visit the Phoenix_Scottsdale area, I make visiting this restaurant a priority_  The food is delicious and very reasonable priced, especially compared to Genghis Grill_  The food and the recipes at YC's are significantly better than Genghis_\n\nI believe for _9_95 (1 big bowl), don't quote me on the price, you get the entree with rice, noodles, soup, drink, and ice cream_  Even it is a dollar more, you will not be disappointed_  Looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix!\n\n06",)("Just come here! You won't regret it_\n\nMake your own stir fry_ Fresh meats and veggies cooked to perfection in your own concoction of savory sauce_\n\nAlso enjoy unlimited beverage, rice, and soup_\n\nHands down the best choice for mongolian grill!",)("First time at this YC's in Tempe_ I've been to a couple others in the valley with mixed success_ This location seemed different, in a good way_ \n\nThe hostess asked if I'd been there before, to which I said: 'No'_ She explains how a buffet works and then went thru an example meal with me_ Very nice service_ \n\nAs I made my way thru the line, what she had said made perfect sense_ This location offered small sheets of paper to 'squash down' the bowl, so you can fit more_ Never saw that at the other locations_ \n\nThe meats were frozen but shaved thin so they cook up on the hot table_ You the fill your bowl with whatever you can fit, sauce it to taste and then hand it to the cook, who pours it all out onto his hot table, cooks it and then returns it to you in a fresh bowl_ \nThey offered chopped nuts for finish, something the other locations didn't have_ The entire staff was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable_ The spicy beef soup was okay but I would've liked to add some vinegar_ Very good meal tho_ \n\nThe overall experience and value at YC's was excellent and I would highly recommend this location_",)("WOW this place is awesome!!!!!!  Good Healthy choices_  Cooked up exactly the way I want it with ingredients I pick and choose from!!! We will be regulars at this place from now on ( and we won't have to break the bank to go often)_",)('Went here as a recommendation from a friend_ It was amazing_ By far the best Mongolian grill i have been to_ Everything tastes fresh and is made there_ The portions are big as I did the large portion and ate until I could no longer eat and took the rest home and had some more later_ Staff was amazing as when they found out t was our first time they helped us through the line and with the sauce selection_ Excellent service and delicious food!',)("Solid Mongolian grill_  Pretty standard_  Get your bowl, pack it with meat, veggies and noodles then make a sauce from one of the recipes on the board or go kamikaze and create your own sauce_  I always try the latter option hoping to discover some amazing combination that hasn't been thought of_  It seems pretty hard to mess it up though_  Depending on what you choose its going to come out one of 2 ways__ spicy or not spicy_  I don't really like being forced to buy a drink with the bowl price, but overall a good lunch_",)("I love love love YC's_  Where else can I fill a bowl with massive amounts of meat and veggies for like _9?  \n\nI went here tonight with my wife and another friend_  It was about 6:30 and it wasn't that busy so that was nice_  It didn't take long for me to fill up my bowl with goodies to the brim and drown it in sauce_  I did mess up a bit with the sauce because it didn't turn out as spicy or as flavorful as I would have liked but it was still great_\n\nIn my opinion I don't come here nearly enough_  I probably only say that though because I purposely didn't view their nutritional info so I'm convinced it is relatively healthy_  I mean its not fried fast food stuff, right?\n\nAnyway I love eating here_  The food is great for what it is, the price is right and the service is very good_  Plus I always have leftovers for lunch the next day_\n\nOh___and the frozen yogurt is garbage_",)("I have been going to yc's for years and the experience is always the same_  I would like to compliment the chef (me) about choosing such perfect fresh ingredients into my stir fry bowl_  The sauce was exactly what I wanted since I was the one who made it_  \n\nThe service is always great and the place is clean_  Perfect for lunch or dinner!",)('This place was great_  11_00 bucks all included, drink,soup, and ice cream to finish it off_  You can create your own favor and all_  The place was packed_   We will visit again when we come to town!!!',)('Awesome_  Been going there for years_  I love that they have sauce recipes to help you_  They have tons of parking_',)("This place is totally awesome_  Coming from So Cal, I've been searching for a Mongolian restaurant as I like the option of creating my own stir fry_  Not only am I creating my own stir fry but I can create my stir fry with the healthiest options possible_  Be prepared to fill your bowl with as many veggies and meat as you want_  It's pretty interesting how you are allowed to _smoosh_ your veggies_meat down so you can fill your bowl for as much as you want_  I was going to rate this establishment a 4 star as it was not pointed out to me that the hostess should actually guide you through the process_  I kinda stumbled my way through especially with the sauce mixture_ However, when I ran into the owner at the yoga studio where I practice and told her about my disappointment, she made it right by sending a gift card for a lunch or dinner for two_  Now, that is what I call excellent customer service_  YC's is a must try!!!!",)("This was my first time at Mongolian Grill and it was amazing_ When we walked in we were greeted by a nice girl and everyone was very helpful _ The food was amazing and I brought a doggie bag home it was so much food, I didn't even fill the bowl_ I will definitely be back !",)('We were in the area looking for a place for lunch_ The wife found this place on Yelp_  We stopped in and they had what we were looking for_ We had never been to this one_ The food was good and there was plenty to eat_ Great flavor_  Not really knowing how the place worked_ Fortunately for us Alexia was the hostess_ She was very professional and friendly_  She asked if we had been there before and explained how it all worked_  She then came by while we were selecting our food and made sure we knew how to select our food_  She came back and made our sauce for us and took our food to the cook for us_  She checked on us twice while we were eating_ The food was great and Alexia made the experience a good one_ Thank you Alexia',)('The food was great, but what made me take the time to sit down and write a review was how helpful Jordan was_  Right when I walked in the door she was helping me out_ When she found out it was my first time there she walked me thru everything and made sure I knew how everything worked_ I go to a lot of places and she was one of the best I have seen!',)("By far some of the best customer service around_ The employees are super accommodating in making sure you don't have any questions while in line_ They help with making sauces and were genuinely caring people_\n\nNot to mention the food was awesome and lasted for about 2 whole meals after- would definitely recommend and awesome customer service!",)("Your meal is what ever you make of it, so make it a good one_  Ok so I stole that line from back to the future but it is true_ Imagine a salad bar but with raw Asian food ingredient with  cook at the end_ One big pro about this style is that you can get just what you want_ I for example do not eat meat_ YC's allows me to cram as many veggies, noodles and tofu into a bowl as humanly possible_ For me it has become a game, how many bowls can I fill post cooking_ My current record is three_ I can give you bowl construction tips if you would like_ If it is not in the bowl it will not be cooked_\n\nThe sauces play a big role in the flavor of your meal_ If you ask they will let you take a separate bowl for sauce and even help you mix_ I like to make my own with generous amounts of garlic and hunan sauce_ If you do like garlic like I do be sure to ladle garlic from the bottom of the container as that is where the real pieces are_ \n\nAfter you leave the cooking line you can augment your food with fried won ton strips, spicy oils, mustard's, peanuts, fresh cilantro, sesame seeds, pineapple and more_ There also is a station with rice and soups for those who require more than just a bowl of Asian goodness_ Soda is included with the meal price and for dinner so is access to the frozen yogurt machine_ \n\nIf you can not finish your meal they will gladly sell you to go boxes at _50 a piece_  \n\nThe one thing that confuses me is the name, Mongolians are a nomadic people, yet their BBQ grills are huge I don't see how that would work_",)('Tried this place for the first time this weekend!! Loved it:) will be back! Next time I will def add extra sauces though_ Yum!!',)("It's great: walk in, get a bowl, smush as much into a bowl as you can, add sauce, they cook, you eat_\n\nPick the meats you like_ I usually stick with beef_ Add veggies_ I pick lots of mushrooms_ I add tofu to add protein_ Pour on sauces to flavor_ They have recipes posted to guide you_ Then hand your bowl over to the chef and he cooks it and gives you it back all nice and hot in a clean bowl_ You can then add a bowl of rice, get a bowl of soup, a glass of something to drink and you're all set_\n\nI used to eat here a lot when I lived in Mesa_ We were up here so stopped in and enjoyed lunch_ It's a great value for your buck!",)('The best mongolian grill on the face of the planet_',)("I don't really like Mongolian Grill concepts___ But YC does it right___",)("I went last night at 8:30pm and the doors were CLOSED! \nI just wanted food to go:( why couldn't they attended me!? \n\nThat's a waste of business, closing a half an hour before actual closing time?
