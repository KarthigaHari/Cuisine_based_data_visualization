('The best Mo in Tempe_ The meat is really juicy and bread is crispy, and I also recommend the cold dry noodles there, which is freaking fresh and chewy with some secret chef signature sauce_',)('Tasty food, but space is limited so maybe not good for a group meals_ Service is good, and price is reasonable_ Overall, recommended_',)('This is my favorite Chinese food in Arizona_ The food incredibly authentic! Especially the Ja mo and beef roll, they are my favorite_',)("So sad this place closed had a great price point and amazing food hopefully something like this will open again_ Always looking out for authentic Chinese food that's really good and well priced_",)
