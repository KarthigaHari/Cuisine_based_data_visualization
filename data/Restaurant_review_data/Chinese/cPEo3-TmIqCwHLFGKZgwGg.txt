The soup dumplings were the highlight of our dinner_  I could of had many more_  We will definitely be back!',)("I remember going to the thai place and hawaiin place before that in this plaza before, and I was never impressed with the area or food_  I didn't think I was ever going back until I saw two separate articles from azcentral and new times on Chou's Kitchen_\n\nIt's tucked towards the end of a bland strip mall on the southwest corner of Ray and Alma School_  The decor is simple and clean_  We were seated and helped almost immediately_  I've been raving about these meat pies (don't you just love saying that word?) to my gf all day_  We got the pork meat pies, the bean curd with pork, noodles with shrimp, and green onion pancakes_\n\nThe meat pies were awesome_  Three came per serving_  They tasted like the filling of a pork steamed bun flattened with a flaky savory pastry crust around it_  Excellent_\n\nThe bean curd with pork and celery was crispy, fresh, and not too oily_  It wasn't bad but nothing to tell mom about_\n\nUnfortunately, the green onion pancakes had the look and aroma of deliciousness but lacked green onions to give it a punch_  It tasted like meat pies__ minus the meat_\n\nThe noodles with shrimp was standard fare_  Interestingly enough they used lo mein noodles instead of something thinner we thought they would_\n\nThey were nice enough to offer us a corn like clear soup, but it was very bland_  I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be savory or desert tasting_\n\nOverall, the meat pies are excellent at the place_  We spent _25 and came out full and happy_  It also helps the place was jam packed with asian people which is a good sign_  Next time, I'm going to go back and try some of their soup_stews that I saw everyone else ordering, and I may change my rating_",)('Good chinese food is hard to find in AZ_ This place us legit!!! This is coming from a chinese east coaster_ The beef stew noodles in soup is tasty_ Gotta try the beef pies, they are awesome! The green onion pancakes are pretty good too_',)("Authentically tasting, inexpensive Chinese food amongst a humble collection of restaurant and stores_ We ordered the steamed pork dumplings and chicken stir fry noodles_ \n\nFood: 4 Stars_ I thought the pork dumpling flavors were excellent_ The moist and chewy wrapping conceals the steamy tender pork that is spiced just right_ They are quite hot, so use caution before biting into the dough_ The noodles were also quite delicious and easily deemed _Asian comfort food__ They were somewhat greasy, with that stick to your bones consistency_ The noodles are dense and best shared by at least two people_ \n\nAmbiance_Service: 2 Stars_ Maybe it was just this particular occasion, but I did not feel very comfortable sitting in the restaurant_ Here's why: we were positioned at a booth near the wall, where one side was padded and the other was a wooden bench_ It was fine enough, but then, through the padded side, you could feel every wiggle and squirm from the people in the booth behind us_ At one point, I found myself battling against them to keep my back support in a normal upright position! Meanwhile, my wife ordered a coke (served in a can) and I had water_ Neither were refilled nor did we see the servers very much to even ask_ These aren't deal breakers, but a little added attention would have done wonders for the evening_ \n\nOverall, I like what I tasted and would be willing to come back and try out more from the menu_",)("After reading the reviews on this place we just had to go_ We met up with some great friends who live in the same area_ Thankfully they are foodies just like we are, so we ordered up a plethora of deliciousness and the person who waited the table told us we must have did a lot of research ahead of time_ We had the eggplant with potatoes and jalepena, beef pies, sesame bread with green onion, pork pot stickers which had this terrific crusty top, pork rib noodle soup (with homemade noodles), ribs with green beans potatoes and eggplant and shredded potato with jalepeno_ Nothing was short of just darn delicious_ Highly recommend anyone to just try this place but don't expect the standard Chinese fare of orange chicken or fried rice dishes_ The waitress was hilarious and added a flair to the whole experience_ Friday night at 6:45 and we were seated immediately, the place was packed and well worth it!",)("So, Im guessing this is authentic asian cuisine_ Some items on the menu, didn't seem very appetizing to my Americanized pallet_ (Pig intestine___) Anyway, we went here on Monday night_ We were greeted sort of happily in the quiet restaurant_ (Seemed liked it needed a healthy clean and remodel)_ Anyway___we ordered the steamed potstickers and beef pies for appetizer_ Beef pies were like pierogi with a softer than wonton outside_ They were a bit greesy, but my dinner guests liked them_ The potstickers didn't arrive until after the other food arrived___annoying_ But they were fairly good with their 'pate type' pork filling_ (No sauce to dip in, btw)_ We then ordered the sweet and sour chicken, house special stir fry, and shrimp fried rice_ SS chicken was terrible_ It was so hard and crunchy, I could hardly eat it_ My 3 year old son couldnt either_ Although the sauce was nice_ And my husband insisted it was pork, with the meat we could barely taste_ The house special (beef, shrimp, chicken) was okay_ I didnt try much_ And the fried rice, super bland_ It needed soy sauce or something! When asked if they had sauce on the side for it to add, they said no_ They had no sauce_ What??? Service was subpar and the meal was subpar_ However, I commend them on how busy the restaurant got after 5:30pm_ We must have misordered, or weren't too adventurous enough or something to find the gems of this place_ So sorry we couldn't like it_ :( Maybe we'll try again?",)("Chou's offers the best Chinese food in Arizona, hands down_\n\nGranted, that sounds like a back-handed compliment such as _the tallest building in Fresno_ or _the best song by Nickleback,_ but the food is truly outstanding_ The Phoenix area now offers several good Asian eateries and Chou's is at the top of the pack_\n\nOn our first visit, we had the potstickers, Kung Pao Chicken and Green Beans with Pork_ Holy [fill in the blank] were they amazing_ The owners were great too, offering great conversation, advice and lightning-fast service_ \n\nMost Chinese food in town is really lousy_ A few restaurants are acceptable in a pinch_ But I would be proud to bring guests from any city to Chou's and they would love every bite_",)("Most authentic chinese restaurant in Phoenix_ I was spoiled living in NYC and is thankful to have found this place_ The food isn't fancy chinese but is very home style_",)("I just left here_ Haven't been here before and will not come again_ I ordered two dishes_ One of them looked like something I had eaten before at another, similar, restaurant_ I didn't like it and they said they were sorry and left it on the table_ When it came time to pay it was on the bill_ You order, you pay_",)
