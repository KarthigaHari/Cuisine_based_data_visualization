("Had the dan dan mian, rich with sesame paste and peanuts, and pretty hot from chili oil and Sichuan peppercorns -- if you're not used to hot food might want to ask them to make it not too hot; had the pedestrian-sounding beef chow mein, probably one of the most delicious chow meins I've had in memory, noodles were al dente, beef was tender_ Big flavors in the garlicky saut ed string bean dish as well as the family style fried bean curd dish, which came with a lovely savory sauce_ Finally the pot stickers in red chili oil were perfectly fried, and the filling was pretty tasty_ Pretty great restaurant_",)('Pretty awesome Szechuan spicy food here including noodles and stir fried dishes_ Fast cooking and careful service_',)('The food was so delicious_ I have been here for several times?recommend tofu?and noodle_ And the price is reasonable too!',)('Probably the best Chinese_ Japanese around_ Tight knit family with good employees_ Never had a bad meal here!',)('The food are always delicious here, no matter the meat, vegetable or soup, especially for the beef noodle soup and appetizers_ The staff are very friendly and efficient, very nice to dine in here',)('Very good chinese food in AZ_ Excellent and delicious!

Definitely will keep coming back and thank you very much!',)("Ordered take-out one night through their online ordering service, and food was delicious! We ordered some noodle soups and of course some other spicy dishes_ The noodle soup looked plain, but it was surprisingly packed with flavor!! The dan dan noodles were ridiculously spicy and left a tingly sensation in our mouths (must have been a new seasoning we never had before because there were no allergic reactions)_ Only 4 stars because I don't have direct experience with their staff to review service, but the food was delicious! Definitely going back!",)('This place is delicious and very authentic from what I can tell_ The service is great, but if you are not chinese they do drop a lot of the spiciness_ We asked for it to be spicier, and they gave us chili oil_ That did the trick but I think theyre still trying to figure out how to appeal to chinese and non-chinese americans_ Fine with me___ definitely worth a try_',)('This place is amazing and my favorite Szechwan food in Tempe!
