('Chinese food is not dead, thanks to Jade Palace_ Located on Hayden and the corner of Via de Ventura, it is a local hidden treasure with a great ambiance at a reasonable price_ Although the dining is set up for intimate parties of 2 or 4, they accommodated my birthday party of 20 with ease_ (Definitely call ahead!) White table cloths, dim lighting, and a impressive wine list (try the plum wine) gives a sense of class but food is good and price is reasonable_ Must try food include: won ton soup (best I have ever had, tons of fresh snow peas, carrots, shrimp, and won tons), steamed sea bass and ginger, BBQ pork ribs and the yang chow fried rice_ Service is quick and super-friendly (Henry is an awesome!)_',)("SO Sad_ This particular location has closed, due to lower traffic_ The location on 92nd street and Shea is still open, as is their other one_ They deliver for a few bucks, which is great since I can't always leave the office for lunch but I still want my JP!",)('I LOVE this little place_  It is around the corner from my office, so obviously extremely convenient_  But I was really pleased when a co-worker and I asked if we could be seated and served within our alotted half-hour lunch that day, and the server said, _Absolutely!_  He was right_\n\nI think the price cannot be beat: soup, main meal, and a couple of additional appetizer-type additions for a mere _6_95!\n\nWhat is really terrific is that this is no average Asian restaurant_  It has some atmosphere, so the great lunch prices are unexpected and a total BONUS!  I have already returned twice in the last month!',)("This place was in a cute little shopping strip in the corner next to TCBY, which was hard to find at first, but I was surprised at how nice it was inside_ I think it's a little more _Americanized_ in the sense that there were not a whole lot of asian workers there_ Their service was really good, the host guy spoke really soothingly like I was in a spa when he took my order (to go)\n\nI had read they had great lunch specials so I got the shrimp with vegetables, which came with fried rice, crab puff, egg roll, and wonton chips_ Wasn't a fan of the spicy mustard dipping sauce, but they gave two types of sweet and sour sauce and I liked those_ I also got the wonton soup (shrimp and chicken with veggies), shrimp chow fun, and a small order of the flash fried green beans_ I liked that they used big shrimp and that I didn't get a stomach ache, which can happen when I eat chinese a lot of times_ \n\nI think I'll be back to try some more of the lunch specials and I kind of want to try the sea bass if I feel like splurging! Oh, because I ordered so much food, the guy thought that it was for 3 people and said he put in three sets of utensils for me_ I just eat a lot and like leftovers, but he was too nice for me to correct =P",)
