("We walked in on a whim to get some food to go_  The service was fast and the lady at the counter was really nice_  We got home to eat and the food was great!  We got the House Fried Rice, Wantons, Lo Mein, and Orange Tofu_  All fantastic!  We've been looking for a good Chinese food restaurant close by and it looks like the search is over_  Definitely coming back for our next craving_",)("Decided to try some Chinese food while visiting Phoenix and found this place on Yelp_ The owners were extremely friendly_ We ordered a family combo to feed 4 and it was more than enough food_ The food was the best Chinese takeout we've had in years_ It was extremely fresh and had tons of flavor_ Definitely higher end quality food and would love to have them again!",)("Super friendly service and great food for the value_ I love supporting local businesses and this one is family owned and deserves to be tried_ It's hard to find good Chinese in Phoenix and I would totally recommend this place! Coming back again for sure!",)("Well I grew up in the Pacific North West where there are Teriyaki joints on every corner_ This place is so clean and the food reminds me of my favorite fast food Chinese Restaurants growing up_ The price is right the food is good and the place is so clean_ Well worth going back can't wait to try their pork egg rolls",)("Got a flier in my door but they don't deliver, no problem, went to pick up, place needs a facelift_ But the whole plaza is a little dreary_ Ordered general tso chx and orange chx_ They both look and taste the same_ I wonder if I got two of the same thing? Egg was good_ Crab Rangoon's were small but there was 8 instead of some places that give u four big ones_ Kinda curious what the kitchen looks like, with their stock of extra soda cans visible from the back side of the counter and a handwritten hours sign on the door_ Was also hoping there's be a few pieces of carrot, onion or broccoli in the entrees but alas it was only fried chicken pieces sauced up_",)("I went in today to pick up a to go order and boy am I glad I found this place_ I tried the Ma Po tofu and sesame chicken and it was sooooooo good, and the portions are huge_ My boyfriend and I couldn't finish it_ Also if you order _15 or more you get a free soda can, which was pretty neat_ I highly recommend this place and cant wait to try more!",)("We just tried this new place and I'm telling you - it has the best Mongolian beef I've had in years! Nice and spicy without hiding the flavor - the beef is really tender and not too chewy_ The sweet and sour pork is fairly average, although fresh and not overdone_ I'd never had crab rangoons before - and they were presented as a dessert - fried wontons with a really yummy cream cheese filling - delish! Really, really good take out Chinese_ Highly recommend_",)("I'm in love with this place_  I've been there 4 times in 2 weeks_  The owners are very welcoming_ The food is good and the prices are right_  I've enjoyed the shrimp (big shrimp) with lobster sauce, garlic shrimp (big shrimp), chicken egg foo yung, beef and broccoli, and mei fun_  Did I mention the shrimp is big?  That's always a ++++_  It's a small restaurant but the food is great!  Highly recommend_",)("We loved the food not to mention the service and prices! If you haven't given them a try you are definitely missing out!",)("Ordered over the phone and stopped in to pick up_ They got our order wrong (served us chicken instead of beef) but the food was so good we didn't even care_ Jalape o chicken was spicy and delicious_ The Mongolian beef was smokey and tender but very heavy on the onion_ Just wish there had been more meat_ \n\nI'll be back, soon, to check out the other options_",)("This takeout is a diamond in the rough! Delicious food, great prices!  \n\nIf you're a vegan, there's several dishes you'll love here: try the Vegetable Chop Suey, our favorite, or one of several tofu dishes, mixed vegetable, or noodle dishes_  \n\nIf not vegan, they have Chinese roast pork that is to die for, which we like in their house special egg foo young, which is loaded with lots of goodies on top_  And they have very affordable complete dinner combinations, all delicious and at amazing prices_ \n\nSee the menu photos, find your favorite, and take home today!",)('Stopped in for Sunday lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the service and food_  We had Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Mongolian Beef, Moo Goo Gai Pan and combination fried rice_  I would recommend, you will not be disappointed_',)("After returning home and seeing that my favorite Chinese food placed had closed, I was pleasantly surprised that a few weeks later this spot opened in its place_ I hate to say this but the food is even better and the portions are HUGE!!! Their crab rangoon was stuffed to the gills and their boneless bbq ribs were plentiful and delicious_ Oh and the rice? Yup equally delicious too_ Needless to say I'm still doing a happy dance and I look forward to returning and trying numerous items from their menu_",)('Small family restaurant w_ great customer service \nPlace is Mainly for takes outs, Good food very tasty_ Definitely recommend this place _',)('Had the Sesame chicken, nice texture full of flavor_ Rice was nice and hot, all packaged in individual to go containers_ Tasty food, not bad price! Great service! Great food!',)('Great customer and you get allot of food for the price would_definitely plan on returning in the future',)("Yi's Chinese is a Chinese Take Out Restaurant located in North Phoenix_ This isn't a fancy restaurant and actually looks a little worn even though it's newly opened_ When you walk in it appears that you order at the counter but on our visit the lady there told us to seat ourselves and she served us_ They offer the usual lunch specials and the menu entrees come in small, large and extra large_\n\nI tried the Szechuan Chicken_ WOW! It was full flavored and SPICY! Not too sweet or salty either_ It was packed with lots of nose running CHILI and Garlic and was DA BOMB! It was delicious! It also was packed with lots of masterfully prepared super tender chicken that melted in my mouth_\n\nMy husband tried the Hunan Beef_ For me it wasn't as complex and full of flavors as the Szechuan but I think it was made the way it is suppose to be_ It tasted like soy sauce and was made with black bean paste_ It also wasn't as spicy_ My husband said the beef was ok_______for me it was not nearly as good as the chicken_ (but I am picky that way)\n\nI have to say the Szechuan Chicken at Yi's Chinese Restaurant was MIGHTY Flavorful and Spicy! The Chicken also was Masterfully Prepared_ (not crappy or bland like most places in North Phoenix) The large is a very big portion and I thought I had a meal for latter but the Dang Food was so delicious my husband Scarfed it up!\n\nYi's Chinese is now a new favorite and will be on my local rotation_\n\nThank you for bringing something delicious to North Phoenix!",)
