("This place sounded promising from the yelp reviews_  So we gave it a shot_  We ordered take out and it was ready in 15 minutes_  \n\nWe ordered:\nHouse Lo Mein\nGeneral Tso's Chicken\nEgg Rolls\nCrab Puffs\n\nEverything was just ok_  The flavors were good but nothing made me want to come back_  The General Tso's chicken was pretty spicy and a good flavor but a little bland_  I was left wanting more flavor_   The house LoMein was good as well but a little bland_  The meat was cooked well and tasted good_  The Egg Rolls had good flavor but were a little soggy on the inside_  Crab Puffs were ok as well_  Everything was just 'ok'_  \n\nI wouldn't go back here_  I would choose Wong's Jr over this place_  Good China is just that--Good, not Great_  If you're in this area and you're looking for chinese, go to Wong's Jr_",)("Service is good but the food is really good_  If you are looking for something authentic and you want something different than the usual Panda Express and PeiWei this is the place to come_  The orange chicken its cooked different from any other place I've ever been and its really good_  I haven't tried a dish that I didn't like_  Order the dinner for two and you will be very pleased_  Fried rice soup its great too_",)('This is an update, we have been back numerous times including dining in_ Still love this place for a great neighborhood joint with good portions at a reasonable price_ The sesame chicken tonight was awesome, but next time I will ask them to add some veggies_ We also had the lettuce wraps and bean curd dish_ I could do those wraps for lunch often, they are on the appetizer menu_ I like the crisp lettuce with warm filling_ Very refreshing_',)("First impression_ Not bad_ It's a clean place_ Staff is friendly_ They were blasting some 80's music inside_ Not my thing but hey___ Lol_ So I ordered the Kung Pao chicken_ The girlfriend got the Sweet and Sour chicken_ I'm always on a mission to find some Kung Pao that can beat Chows Asian Bistro in Albuquerque_ Sadly it doesn't top Chows_ The food was good don't get me wrong_ As stated in a review from someone else_ It's good not great_ My girlfriend also got a Long Island Iced Tea_ She said that was awesome_ All in all not a bad place_ I'd go here again probably_",)("Service was good, food was horrible_ Nothing had flavor, food was cold, tasteless and gross_ We had to run through McDonald's to get my wife something and that was better than good china_  Would not recommend it",)('Great mom and pop place in Peoria_  You have to try their Lettuce wraps which are very refreshing and on the light side_  Dumplings are made fresh so if you order them they take 15-20 min to get_  Fried rice is to die for too!!',)("Hot & Sour soup is a favorite of ours and since the old Eddie Chan's closed and sold the name we have searched_  Good China makes a nice one, plus their luncheon menu is well priced, the portions are more than ample and the food is tasty_  The only negative we found were the egg rolls which were very good but soaked up oil_  A much hotter frying oil would crisp them up and rate them up there with the Hot & Sour Soup_  Overall, good, inexpensive lunch with a pleasant atmosphere and nice people_  Try it, we will again_",)
