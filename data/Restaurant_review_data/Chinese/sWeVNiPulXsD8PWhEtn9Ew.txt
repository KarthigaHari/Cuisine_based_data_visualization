("I absolutely love this place_ I was worried at first that it would be a standard mall asian food counter but was definitely wrong_ The food is fantastic and the service is great_ I've been going regularly so that I can get the Teriyaki Chicken and Sesame Chicken_ Each has a very rich taste, and the sauce_glaze is fantastic_ This is the only food in the food court that consistently has a line, but the line moves quick and the food is definitely worth it_",)("Oh my gosh delicious!!!!!! Can't wait to go again!!! It's definitely worth waiting in line for_",)("This place is probably the only redeeming factor of metro center mall_ The mall is horrendous these days and nothing like the Golden days_ However if you're still in the area and looking for some quality food then give jade a try_ The food is delicious_ Tastes fresh and the staff are friendly as can be_ If I could only recommend one thing on the menu is would certainly be their crab puffs_ Don't hesitate_ Eat jade today_",)("OMG OMG OMG OMG FORGIVE ABOUT PANDA EXPRESS! This Is THE Best FAST FOOD Chinese place in the world_ If only they had more of these open I swear they would make panda express lose all there business_  They so are not stingy with there food unlike panda, where sometime don't give you enough of something on the menu_ The 2 entree plate is like your getting a 3 entr e plate you get so full that you can't finish all of your food I swear you guys that GOOD! I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! Every time I get paid I come here LOL",)('We have been coming here for years_ Yesterday we decided to get this for dinner_ My wife got the chow mein noodles and orange chicken w_ a side of rice_ I got the orange chicken and kung pow chicken w_ some rice_ My wife was almost finished eating her orange chicken, when she bit the chicken in half and seen that some of the chicken was raw_ She ended up not finishing the orange chicken_ They do give big portions',)('Good food, fast & cheap\nGreat hot sauce too!',)('?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????',)('The only food I will eat in the mall_ All employees are very nice & the prices are good for the amount of food you get_ Recommend this place to everyone!',)('This place was so delicious_ They made my food fresh and were super friendly_ The chicken shawarma is sinful_',)("The food is absolutely fantastic_ I'm craving it as I speak_ I like that brown rice is used for the fried rice_ I've never had that variation before_ The sesame chicken, orange chicken and kung pao shrimp were my favorite_ I would highly recommend it_ The owner is the friendliest :)",)("One thing I miss about Arizona_ They have good quality food and the employees are very nice_ I haven't been in almost a year but I crave it regularly_ My mother who still goes to Metro often stated that they upped their prices so she is no longer going which sucks as their prices were already a bit on the steep side compared to the same plating options at similar food chains_ I have since moved out of state and can't find anything that can quite compare_",)("I just ate at Jade, was my second time, and it is far away my favorite Asian food in town!  The owner was actually working the front line and I let him choose his favorites for me_  I met him once before when he was catering an event for a friend of mine and that's when I feel in love with the food!  Highly recommend!!",)("I've been going here for 30 years and getting nothing but the BBQ Pork Fried Rice_ In all those years, I've never found better BBQ Pork Fried Rice anywhere else_ And in that time, I've lived in Minneapolis and New England_ When I return to Phoenix to visit friends and family, I always return here for the best BBQ Pork Fried Rice anywhere!",)("I am down from 5 stars to 2 stars_ After 20 years, I guess food is going to change_ The people that made the food delicious and unique, to every other Chinese place, are gone_ Except the sweet, wonderful cashier; who always makes us feel welcome_ She knows my family, and always asks about them_ She hasn't changed, just the food_ The tall Asian woman with very short hair and bangs, is always rude___ If we ask her a question, she just looks at you with contempt__ Very rude_ She will  cause them to lose business! They have finally lost me_ I won't ever go back_ The Orange Chicken is typical of every other Chinese restaurant?_ It has that orange color with the crunchy shell with little chicken in it___ __ Sauce is dry___ Noodles are dry___ The spicy Chicken, which used to be my favorite, is not the same__new color, new sauce, big slices of onions_ Also, they don't say Chicken gizzards, they just say _chicken__ These gizzards have more stringy fat on them_ It is still my favorite food there, but different_ Good bye sweet  Cashier and parting is sweet sorrow, JADE_",)("Panda Express has nothing on this place_ Yeah its a little bit more price wise but you get a whole lot more!! Taste wise its delicious and always fresh_ The ladies here are so nice and sweet_ Im not a Kung Pao type of guy but their version is really amazing_ Orange chicken is always crispy and savory with that pungent orange sauce_ Teriyaki is also good, they grill it and you could really taste the grill difference_ I definitely come to this place even if I'm not in to shop(lets admit it, metro center mall is the cemetery for stores)_ \nP_s - definitely reminds me of those California choose you items type of restaurants_ Taste wise and quantity wise_",)("This place is nasty_ What are they serving?!  I'm still sick from the _chicken_ I ate 2 days ago_ Gross!!",)("I don't know what James is thinking--Panda Express doesn't compare_\n\nI've eaten here over 50 times_ It's always the same _ _ _ it's always awesome_",)("I've been going here since I moved to AZ about 14 years ago and I've never had such incredible beef and broccoli, fried shrimp or fried rice anywhere else in Arizona_ The women that have worked behind the counter for as long as I can remember are the sweetest, funniest and they always have great customer service_ Which is hard to find in Metro Center, I love this place so much always 100% perfect!",)
