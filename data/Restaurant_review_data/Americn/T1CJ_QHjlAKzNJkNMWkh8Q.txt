("Such nice folks, love the Cuban sandwich! \nOwners are super nice_ Best place to order food when pool side at Starpointe_ \nThey also have great salads and a kid's menu_ Big burgers and not overpriced_ \nYou can even get Popsicles for the hot summer days!",)('Great food and very friendly staff_ \nWill return soon_',)('Came here while being at the pool and was hungry! I got a hotdog and a soda and my son got the burger_ Took a long time to get our food from the time we ordered_ The staff was very nice but thought the food was a little over priced for the flavor or lack there of_ Will try this place again though_',)
