Thanks Gina!!!',)("This is my go to neighborhood bar, not the closest to me 3+miles but I can count on a friendly welcome from the awesome bar tenders_ I only come every coupple of weeks but they make me feel like an everyday regular_ No this is no dive bar it is a great neighborhood bar, clean and friendly with decent bar food and I am not bombarded by loud sports but insted a good jukebox_ This is not to say there isn't sports on but the sound is generally low or off ( oh thank you so much) for us not into sports at all times and allows for good company_ There is also live music (not my thing) which can be fun_ The owner is geneally arround and will give you a friendly hard time as he did to me the first time I was there, and I truly felt welcome_ I also just wanted to give a shout out to the best bartenders in town I do not remember there names but you know who you are (crazy currly black hair) and the rest of the crew_ Thanks so much for what I feel is a community service, the neighborhood bar a dying breed_",)('6 of us walked in from Barrett Jackson and the service to food has been amazing!!

We were greeted by the owner when we walked in and all of the staff were equally as friendly_  The Saturday night band was great - they played a nice selection of music_  We haven't tried the food yet, but hear it's very good_  My only complaint is that this bar is not in MY neighborhood!",)('Excellent food and great people !\nThe band on Friday and Saturday nights is great \nBreakfast and bloody marry on the weekends !!',)("This place is exactly what you are looking for in a local neighborhood bar!  It seems that it was recently renovated and it looks nice without being pretentious_  The food was tasty, came out hot and quick_  Staff was really friendly and the regulars (it was that feeling_  Like folks are there a lot and enjoy coming back) were chatty_  The owner came by to check on us after we ate, and see how we were and if we liked our lunch_  I like that!

Well the grill has also improved in recent years and the food is sure to satisfy your tummy, as they have a decent menu, and the food is well prepared and comes out promptly_  \nWe have always received good service from the attentive staff, so you won't find yourself sitting with an empty glass wondering if your server has been abducted by aliens_ No, in fact I was about to finish my drink and before I could even think about reaching for my glass, my server gave me the _are you ready_ look, and with a _thumbs up_ from me, I had a fresh drink sitting in front of me, before I had even finished the last drink of my original glass_\nSo if you find yourself in South Scottsdale and need to wet your whistle, stop by_ You can thank me later!",)("First time here and the fish and chips were delish_ Great value and good beer selection_ Want to come back when there's music_",)('I come here pretty often, but I still miss the old El Dorado_  I enjoy all the food here, but I miss the way they used to make their fries when they had different owners_  They used to make them perfectly crispy and softer in the middle_  Now, they are done extra, extra crispy_  Some people like that, I suppose_  I miss Tammy, as well_  Tammy was my favorite bartender at The El Dorado_  She always provided above and beyond customer service_  The new servers are great, too_  Tammy was just my favorite_  What happened to Tammy?  :(  Overall, this place is great_  I can relax and enjoy a few drinks_  :)',)('Great place to play pool and hang out awesome karaoke nights and ginger is a hoot!

I asked about it, since it was obviously not a food service patty that they used and the bartender let me know that they get thier ground beef from French's which is local butcher that is down the road! What a great idea and it makes for a wonderful burger_ The wings were well seasoned and the sauce was yummy_  I asked for extra veggies and they brought them to me no problem! \nThey also have pool tables, so I will have to return with some of my friends to this spot for some beer, a game and maybe some pool!",)('Always great food and drink specials served by a very friendly staff!
