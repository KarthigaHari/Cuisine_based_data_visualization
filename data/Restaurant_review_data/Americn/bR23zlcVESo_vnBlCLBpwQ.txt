("Wonderful little cafe! Found it on Yelp, was not disappointed_ I've had Cuban sandwiches all over the country, this one was the best_ Great, friendly service, good prices, great value! Do yourself a favor, SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! All delicious_",)("OH HAPPY DAY!   The new Betty's Rooste has opened!  Same great food and DESSERTS!  Liz is there along with her friendly staff_  Come in and see for yourself_\nNow there are two Betty's to choose from_",)('This place is far better than you can imagine_ \nYou will enjoy every bite_ Best food in Sun City_',)('We went for breakfast_ Normal breakfast fare at reasonable prices_ Service was good, and food came hot and fresh_ Will probably give lunch a try at some point_',)("Very good spot for a sandwich_ I wouldn't come here with a large group as seating is limited_ My mom and I both had a sandwich and chips also with a drink_ Tip and bill total under _20_ I will definitely return if I'm in the area_",)("We found this place on Yelp since I was meeting some folks right in the building were Betty's is located_  Despite the great reviews, we didn't know what to expect_  It looks like a luncheonette in the first floor lobby of a medical office building_  Not an auspicious first impression_  Our opinion changed as soon as we walked in the front!  Everybody was super friendly_  The owner waited on us and made some suggestions as to what we should order_  I had a breakfast platter and my wife had one of the daily specials_  Everything, including the baked goods, are made fresh_  They source the bread for their toast from a special local bakery_  These are just little touches you don't expect in such a modest location_  When we asked for the check, I had to look twice to make sure everything was included, it was that inexpensive for what we got_\n\nHighly recommended!",)("I wish I had taken photos of my food before I ate it!  I had the Reuben & an extra side of pasta salad_ Both were amazing_  The deserts are fresh baked_ I couldn't decide between the 5 choices___  the pies looked amazing_  The service was quick and friendly_ I thought the prices for a good lunch were low_  I am stuffed and I will be back again!!",)('Food is in the mediocre to good range, nothing crazy special_ They have a nice variety_ It gets the 4 star bump for dessert_ You know what is badder than a bangle tiger? The peanut butter tiger cookie from here!',)('The best secret for breakfast or lunch in Sun City Az_ Check out the pictures, now multiple the flavor of the food 10 times_ Fantastic place to eat_ Also Betty and staff are so nice!',)
