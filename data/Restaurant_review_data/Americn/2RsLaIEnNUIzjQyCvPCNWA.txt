The staff was incredibly friendly and talkative as well_ Tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well_ He showed us the original brick wall towards the back, which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place_ The patio wasn't quite finished, but it will be awesome once done! Love the beautiful iron gate! Hopefully this new place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out! Glendale definitely needs a cool place like this! Tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment!!",)("Food was ok_ I liked the Cajun fries_ I just had a burger_ Burger was good, nothing too special_ Had the hefenweizen-_5 not too bad_ Went on a Friday night at 8____ it was us and one other group there_ Pretty dead, I don't know the area very well, but being a young person, I wouldn't go back at night_ Maybe if I'm in the area and for lunch_ Says happy hour is 3-6___ that may be worth it",)("Amazing! My wife and I love this place! They have REAL top shelf Long Island ice teas_ (Hard to find in Phoenix)_ But the item that keeps us coming back is the grits with shrimp and sausage_ It's awesome! My wife hates grits but this dish just works for some reason_ We highly recommend it along with the Long Island_ It's a hole in the wall but it's a great place to come and enjoy an amazing meal_",)('The ambiance is very pleasant_  We sat outside next to the herb garden and enjoyed trying to guess the different aromas_  The food was not bad either_  The Mac and cheese with shrimp and bacon was ok and the brisket was ok too_  The winner was the Cajun fries_',)("The waitress was lovely making sure the drinks were full, we were happy, and we weren't rushed at all despite being there a long time just chatting_ Food was great and I highly recommend the calamari appetizer and shrimp po'boy_ My friend got the chicken club and member several times how good it was_ The only thing that was unpleasant women sitting at the table next to ours were having a very ugly conversation, but I can't fault them for some their patrons being insufferable_ Next time I come in I'm going to try the shrimp and grits_ It's a really neat setting and I'd have no problem returning or recommending them to a friend_",)("Wonderful restaurant! We wandered in here with a big party and they accommodated us without a wait! The lemon chicken was out of this world! Easily the best chicken I've ever ordered at a restaurant_ Was extremely surprised and satisfied_ Thanks for great service and a great meal!",)('I really liked the atmosphere and think if the hours were more regular more people would come_ I enjoyed the cheese,meat and olive tray__ sorry forgot the formal name___ but it was great_ The Mules we had were really good but we only had one because the were pricey__ and we are not cheap with drink cost_ The entres were good but not fantastic_ We didnt take the leftovers home_ That was a sign_ I mean it wasnt bad but I am not dying to go back_',)('Inconsistent\n\nI loved the meal I had last time in this very cute small historic area of Glendale_ They still do serve up hand crafted above average cocktails in an old charm atmosphere and offer an American Comfort Food Menu with comfortable prices_\n\nThe brisket was so darn great last time I decided to order it_\n\nIt was not the same as last time as it was kind of dry_ It still had a tasty flavor but was not that fresh kind of melt in your mouth kind of brisket_ The brisket did have some fat to it but it just seemed like leftover meat with fat_ It was still passable and not bad but also not great like last time_ The slaw was ok and the fries were hot and fresh but boarder line over salted_ For me they were hard to eat but my husband ate them_ I would still recommend to try the brisket because if you hit them on a good day the brisket might be outstanding_\n\nBased on the shrimp and grits my husband had I would not recommend the shrimp and grits_ A small mound of grits sat in the bottom of the bowl and was topped with a large amount of red sauce that diluted the grits into nothing but soup_ It became just red sauce mixed with grits that got worst from the undercooked poached egg on top that had some raw whites that did nothing positive to this dish_ My husband ate it without sending it back_ I would not have been able to eat his dish_ \n\nI hate like hell to drop this place a star and HOPE that maybe the regular cook was just off that night_\n\nYou should still give this place a try when in the area I just wanted to keep my review honest_',)("Went for dinner last evening_ This is wonderful restaurant_ They have been open about 4 week_ The service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent, can't beat the prices and most important the food was outstanding!  We drove from Surprise and will definitely go back frequently_ Was well worth the 35 mile each way drive_ If you fancy Calamari you will be in AWE of this dish_ And a very generous serving, shared by 4_ I had the Pork Belly tacos for my entree, superb!  Others had shrimp poorboy, and pork roast sandwich_ Everyone loved their food_ Not one complaint_ Give it a try, you will not be disappointed_",)("I drove by this place a couple times and notice it was new_ Then I read about it in the paper and thought why not give it a shot_ Cuff is a very nice addition to old downtown Glendale_ The decor is pretty sweet looking when u first walk in_ It has a modern, yet old school neighborhood bar feel to it_ I like restaurants that are by the street to have big windows_ To me its gives the restaurant life as you see the world around you passing by_ Cuff has a huge window in front_ Which when Glendale Glitters kicks off in about a month the view from Cuff should be fantastic_ \nThe food felt pretty standard to me_ I had the fried shrimp po'boy and it wasn't spectacular, and it wasn't bad either_ The fries that came with it had a nice seasoning over it and they were very crispy_ I just stuck with water so I don't know how good their drinks are_ I will try Cuff again_ Like I said its a nice addition to the town_",)
