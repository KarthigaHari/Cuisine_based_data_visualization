Not so exciting once you actually get the happy hour menu, though, which does NOT match the happy hour menu posted online_ The actual happy hour menu had about 6 options for rolls (salmon, tuna, octapus, etc_) only, all just under _4_ So, not only do you have to request the happy hour menu (which seemed to be intentionally kept secret), but the prices and selection was weak at best_ And maybe it's just me, but I was very unimpressed with the _Apple or Orange juice_ listed on the specials menu at the sushi bar_ I mean, seriously? Although we did get some _freebies_ (miso soup, small bowl of edamame), these tend to be free at most Japanese restaurants and did not make up for all the other issues WHATSOEVER!

My hubby hasn't tried toro before, so he said it's okay, but for me, I think there're way too many tendons in the fish! Toro should be something that will MELT in your mouth (and with this price!) and the aroma should linger in your mouth (from my better experience)! They also added too much vinegar in the rice so the sourness of the rice covered the taste and aroma of the fish_ I'm quite disappointed but I thought I'll wait until I tried out everything to judge_ \n\nOthers weren't particularly bad but I won't say they're very fresh (I liked the albacore sushi though)_  As for the proportion of the fish and the rice (I know I'm super picky, sorry about that), I think I have to agree with Omar who reviewed before_ The size of the fish is way too large compared to the rice_ I remember the first time I read Omar's review, I laughed, _What? Isn't it a good thing to have a bigger piece of fish?_ and _maybe he haven't tried other Japanese restaurants where they have large pieces of fish on top of the rice!____but NOW I know_ The fish was cut much larger and thicker than normal, and I just came to realize that it's not necessarily a good thing_ Because the balance is lost_ It's like placing a piece of sashimi on a tiny bit of rice, and you think you're eating sashimi instead of sushi_ (I like sashimi too, but since I ordered sushi___)\n\nOm___and the spicy scallop sushi were super spicy (even my hubby  who can eat comparatively quite spicy food wouldn't want to take the second piece)_ Thank goodness they gave us some fruit in the end and my tongue felt better (well I can't eat very spicy things in the first place haha, my bad) :p\n\nI hate to criticize like almost everything about the food, since the lady was so very nice!!! I guess if you're not too pampered by fine, authentic sushi before, and you don't care about salty miso soup and stuff, then you might give it a try :)",)("Fantastic_ My wife and I went on a Friday night_ I knew right away when everyone coming in was a regular, that we were in for a treat_ This place is right by our house in a non descript shipping center, that we've driven by hundreds of times_ We found it on yelp tonight and saw the positive reviews_ They deserve it_ \n\nI could tell the owners were Korean, because they spoke it_ I believe it's a family restaurant and they are very aware that positive reviews are return customers are driving their business_ For a Friday night it wasn't really too busy, when we arrive we were seated right away and had the option of seating_ At the risk of writing a positive review and their business improving so much that next time we have to wait_ They deserve it_\n\nBeyond the basics they have an Extensive roll menu, some you've heard of and some house rolls_\n\nFood was fantastic_ Rice seasons well and didn't fall apart_ Fish is FRESH!  Fish to rice ratio was perfect_ We too, will soon be those regulars ;)\n\nThat's it_ Try it or don't, just my opinion ;)",)('Great selection of sushi rolls, sashimi, & other dishes! The customer service is excellent_ Highly recommended!',)("It use to be good_ Walked in today and the placed reeked of old carpet and moldy water_ The AYCE menu used to be ok, but now the rolls and nigiri lack presentation and quality_ I think the woman chef was making the sushi today_ Usually when the man chef makes the sushi he pays careful attention to the details of the sushi_ I don't know if I will be back_ Hopefully they would deep clean the carpet and pay attention to the details of the quality of sushi served_",)("The customer service kills the experience for this place_ I am very understanding that people have a bad day but you are here to earn a paycheck and earn my tip so leave the negative _get out of my restaurant_ attitude at home_ \n\nOtherwise it's a nice looking place with good sushi_ Normal sushi prices_ \n\nYou can buy chopsticks here and eat with them right away_ I believe you can eat from an AYCE menu, and outside says it's conveyor belt sushi but I did not see such a thing inside, tho I did not go to the back_ \n\nI would come again but the customer service experience was not one I want to go thru again_",)('I love Sushi San so much :3\nThe quality, the taste, the choices, the sake, the service, the atmosphere_\nEverything_\nThe employees are the best :)\nI always try something new and I always enjoy it_\nThe rolls are always nicely presented_\nSushi San is my go to :D\nWriting this review makes me want some now',)('I really liked this place_  The service is pleasant and the food is good_  We were not charged for the miso soup we ordered and were brought free edamame and then fruit for dessert_  The rolls (including the happy hour ones) are reasonably priced and yummy_  I also really enjoyed the vegetable tempura_  If I was very hungry one night I would like to try the all you can eat sushi_',)("Really love the sushi here_ Exceeds all the other places I've tried_ The Vegas roll, California roll and spicy tuna are all favorites_ It's clearly family owned which I can appreciate_ Service has always been fast and polite_ Always been comped a bowl of edamame if it's going to be more than a few minutes, and every time I've been there my meal is always followed up with some fresh fruit_  Would definitely recommend",)("This place is amazing I always order the same 3 rolls to go_ They've never messed up an order and  I always leave happy_ The customer service and hospitality is great_ They are a smaller sushi restaurant which gives it a very _homey_ vibe_ I haven't been there to dine in but I'm sure when I do, they will exceed my expectation per usual_ Try the Tiger Roll & I love Salmon roll, those are my personal favorites!",)('Hands down the very best sushi restaurant in Arizona!!! The fish is fresh, rolls are gigantic and the quality of service is impeccable! I have been looking for a place like this since I moved from the east coast!! If you are in the mood for some quality, fantastic sushi, look no further!!',)('Decent sushi for an affordable price_',)("Maybe the other yelp reviewers gave me high expectations, but I was very disappointed with this place_ My husband and I have eaten at many sushi restaurants, but I've actually enjoyed this one the least_ We got the all-you-can-eat sushi and tried about 8 different rolls_ First of all, the rice was way too sweet! It was ok the first few rolls, but I ended up dunking my rolls in soy sauce just to take away some of the sweetness_ Also, the rice-to-sushi ratio was too much_ This place was very obvious about filling you up on rice_ Finally, it was so warm in there! My whole family was sweating and even the sushi was warm_ Gross_ Their sushi isn't terrible (we still finished the plate), but there is definitely better_ The main reason for the 3 stars is the service_ All of the staff there were super nice and we received great service_",)("Well here is impressions with this Restaurant_ We simply loved it_ We went there with a total of about 20 people and they seated us right away_ Everyone ordered and the food was amazing_ They went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect_ It wasn't until after our meal we advised them it was my birthday, they politely asked for proof, and is their policy to give out a free _specialty roll_ to the one celebrating_ in addition to that they took pictures for us and proved copies on the spot, one to keep and 1 to sign to hang on their wall (in their waiting area)_ This is not something I have not seen anyone do (without it being requested by the customer)_ We  will be returning, easily  the best sushi spot i have been to_",)("The sushi was good and I liked that they had a full bar_ They were out of miso soup, which isn't the biggest deal but it was a cold, rainy night and a bowl of miso would have been perfect_ Unfortunately the miso thing was disappointing and kind of tainted the whole experience for me (I know, dramatic_ But it was SO cold!!)_ \nOverall I'd say it's more of a 3 1_2, but I'll most likely return in the future_",)("Not a bad thing to say about this place! We love their food and their service_ Fish is always fresh and we love their _service_____free edamame, tempura, salmon skin___\nThey really do need to hire another server and sushi chef though_ Don't go here if you are in a hurry_ It can take upwards of two hours to eat at their busy times, but we really like the laid back atmosphere, so it's not an issue for us!",)("I noticed the other night that I gave this restaurant a 4 star rating, but really Sushi San deserves 5 stars_\n\nThey treat you like family every time from the first time_  I became a regular from the start_  I bought chopsticks on my second visit there because I knew I would be coming back for more_  And I returned just about every week after that_  And I've taken friends and roommates_\n\nThis is a family owned restaurant and the server is really funny and gives me free items once in a while_  I'm not saying to expect free items and I don't want to advertise that, but maybe that will be a perk for you_  It is for me!\n\nOther than the great service and lovely family that owns the restaurant, the sushi is delicious!  The special rolls are really good_  I always end up eating more than I should because it's so good_\n\nFavorites:\nJust about all the special rolls\nMountain roll\nSpicy tuna hand roll\nMiso soup\nEdamame",)('Still my favorite place to have Sushi!  Plus the owners are fantastic, and the food is top notch_   I always get the Spicy Sashimi Salad with Scallops_',)
