Very clean_ The owner is really sweet and after complimenting his business he hugged us and said I love you',)('Fruit flies everywhere, slow service, forgetful waitress, mediocre sushi, advertised sapporo with saki bomber,  then said it only comes with dry asahi (which was gross)_  1 waitress, 8 tables, overtalkitive manager, who should have helped her more and monitoring the quality of food, drinks being served and minimizing the fruit fly problem_  But he said he felt tired and lazy_  We dropped _75, and felt a little sick to our stomach afterwards___ Coulda been the beer_',)("This place has some amazing potential___my wife and I wanted sushi but, didn't want to drive all the easy to Chandler to get to our usual haunt_ \n\nThough pretty empty, the service was spot on and the food was pretty decent_ This is a hidden gem and we hope the neighborhood will make an effort to support this newly opened joint_",)("It's a great place_ Has potential_  They just need to elevate it a bit more_ They have about 20 beers on tap lager,ipa's 'and Japanese beers_ Sad thing is I walk in and the place is half empty_ Grabbed a beer and ordered some calamari salad_ It was good_ Seems like the staff is struggling due to the competition on the area_ This place has potential of whoever is making the decisions can get their head out there ass___next to a community college____elevate this place!",)("Excellent sushi currently serving all you can eat for 23_00!! Quality rolls, excellent fish and light on the rice_ Loved the service, which was quick and friendly, very attractive restaurant, nice music_ Close to Banner Hospital & Cardons Children's Hospital_",)("I am so torn on this place!! I have been going here sometimes 2 to 3 times a week because we LOVE sushi and its right by our house, BUT they started changing things that brought us in_ The happy hr was perfect for our family because our kids consume a ton of sushi just by themselves and then you have myself and my husband___it adds up quickly_ We found this place to be a treat and that we could all enjoy ourselves and be full at the end of our meal without breaking the bank_ I used to grip about how early they would close on Fri,sat and sun (which was when we would do reverse happy hr)_ Now they stay open till Midnight, but took away reverse happy hr!? Makes no sense_ The reason it was getting so much business at night was because of happy hr_ Needless to say we haven't been back since_ Its certainly not because of the food_ The food is great and we have never had anything bad_ The Salmon is so good here_ Buttery and delicious_ \nI wish them the best and hope they stay  because we desperately need places in the Fiesta area_ The building is also very strange, but I get it_ They can't afford to remodel the entire place just yet_ Hopefully in the future_ I hope they go back to the old happy hr and get the service on point_ It can be so crazy in there! The staff sometimes seems like they don't know whats going on are running around like chickens with their heads cut off_ I have been apart of the service industry for years and so I just want to pull them aside and say relax!! The worst thing a server can do is when greeting the table tell that table about how busy and understaffed you are___which has happened several times to us_ Get it together guys and you could have an amazing restaurant!!",)("Honestly, we bought this _20 Groupon with a little bit of trepidation because it had _Crazy_ in it's name_  Not sure why something like that would worry us, but we were happily surprised_\n\nWhen we walked up from the parking lot, our server Aaron, greeted us as he opened the entrance door for us_  He asked us if we preferred low top or high top and took us into the upper leave aka the bar_ He informed us it was happy hour so we ended up with 2 checks and 2 tables_ (Yep one for the adults and one for the kids_ ) We split checks for our _20 Groupon and one for all our happy hour items_\n\nI rarely give five stars so let me start by saying not only was the service great but the food was out of the world_",)('Everything we have had is delicious_ The dynamite roll was fabulous and we are so excited to have a new sushi place in the neighborhood_',)("The service is absolutely terrible at this establishment_ You can tell that they don't train their waiters, at all, and they can't even say what is included in each dish_ The restaurant wasn't that packed during the lunch hour and yet they were acting as if it was a full house_ They were rude when our table asked for a condiment and at one point was talked down to_ The managers and owners should be embarrassed about their quality of service_ I have never been so repulsed by a dining experience_",)("I had high hopes for this place_ It's about a 5 minute Drive from where I live, and I was excited to have a good sushi restaurant nearby my place_ When I got there it was pretty empty for lunch_ The food was good, nothing outstanding_ Realized no silverware, had to ask for chopsticks_silverware after food was brought out_ Our server overall was not attentive, slow, and seemed annoyed at any requests that were made_ Advice to management-you don't have to have 5 star food if your service is 5 star_ Food was 3 star with 1 star service, so 2 star rating_ It's been a few months and I have not been back, but I may give it another try one day_",)("After attempting to stay away from fish for a while so I don't poison myself with crazy Mercury level, I caved_ Lol However, I don't think I've ever been so disappointed leaving a sushi place as I have with this place_ It was mediocre at best_ Not worth the price that they charge_ Presentation is lovely but we probably should have known better from looking around_ At dinner time in a large city to have just three tables in the restaurant was a sign_ Never again_",)("Sushi isn't cheap no matter where you go unless you hit a place with a luncheon special_  Having said that, this place makes pretty good sushi but they need to work on their service_  When we came in the young lady at the front desk seated us and then went off to get our drink order_  I noticed that the entire time we were there no one manned the front desk and one guy came in and stood there for the longest and almost left if he hadn't gone into the bar to ask for service_\n\nTheir hearts are in the right place but they really need to learn how to run things smoother_  We got hot tea from one girl without a lid_  She said she couldn't find it - really? But when our server came back she noticed it and went to get us another pot that had a lid_  My GF and I each ordered miso soup and upon noticing how good it felt to our dry throats they kept bringing us more - score!\n\nThey kept us in tea until we were floating and we each had two rolls which were yummy_  I was disappointed that they didn't have white tuna nor a fish_avocado combo_  They did make me a salmon avocado roll but I had to pay 50cents extra for it_  They do have some really creative rolls which my friend tried but I stuck with my basic rolls_\n\nI'd come back but they really really need to work on running the business more efficiently_  That may cost them in the end_",)("Don't just look____Go in and see!! This is my new go-to sushi place_\n\nLike others, I was a little skeptical walking in because the restaurant is in the Fiesta district, and the area surrounding the mall is beginning to dwindle_ However, I knew the the restaurant was fairly new, and it was very early for any kind of dinner rush_ But we were hungry, and rather than drive all the way across the Valley, we decided to give it a shot_ And I was glad we did_\n\nI am not blown away very easily, but when I walked in, it shattered all my expectations_ The place is very nicely decorated_ The bar is warm and inviting, and the wait staff matched_ We were greeted warmly and quickly_ We sat in the bar area, which is modern, elegant and classy_ The room has a liquor bar on side, and you may also sit at the sushi bar on the other end across the room_ This would be a great place for an office lunch, meet the girls for lunch, take a client out, first date, 50000th date, or just walk in casual_ The whole restaurant is tastefully decorated, but nobody goes to a restaurant because of how it looks, right? It's all about the food_\n\nOMG the food! Asian restaurants seem to have caught a bit of Mexican Restaurant syndrome these days, where there are so many, but their either generic everybody is trying this and fusion that, and we lose a lot of the integrity and authenticity of the flavors, offerings, and culture_ Crazy Sushi & Crab brings back everything that Japanese cuisine should be, and the food not only tastes good, it has the looks to match_ Our teriyaki beef bento box was served in a beautiful red and black ceramic box_ The beef was cooked medium rare and was tender and juicy and melted in your mouth, which was really surprising because A) Japanses beef teriyaki is usually tough and chewy; and B) non-steak cuts of beef are usually tough and chewy (restaurant-ly speaking)_ The teriyaki was light and aromatic, but full of flavor, as if it was part of the meat itself_ The presentation was delicate and highly visual both in color and shape_ For me personally, I have never met a pot sticker that I liked_ It's just not my thing, but this box came with two of them, so, of course, I tried one_____and I liked it! And we came to the conclusion that maybe there are foods we don't like because we've never had them prepared properly_ In short, I ate BOTH pot stickers and didn't share, even though they weren't mine to eat in the first place_ I had the Yellow Daddy roll and the Vegas roll and I was not disappointed with either_ The Yellow Daddy was light and feisty_ It has a beautiful house specialty sriracha_cilantro sauce that I've never had anywhere else_ It was spicy, and the cilantro goes up your nose the way it should, but it didn't overpower the fish_ The Vegas roll was a more straight forward deep fried tempura roll_ Their tempura batter is light and airy but cruchy and flavorful_ It doesn't hide the food, it enhances it_ It stayed crunch throughout the meal and didn't lose it's pop just because I took my time eating_ In fact, they even have tempura battered sweet potato slices that came in the bento box that had us asking if they were available as an appetizer___it was that good_\n\nMy only regret is that I did not opt to sit at the sushi bar_ I say this because another gentlemen was sitting there, and he was having quite the conversation about all the different fishes and flavors and sauces that were on the menu, and I wanted to go sit there and be part of that_ As anyone who has had good Asian experiences will tell you, food is more than just fork to mouth, it's an experience____but not a missed opportunity for me_ I have eaten a lot of sushi in my time, and now that this place is right around the corner from my house, I plan on eating a lot more_",)("This place was actually very good which I wasn't expecting based on the exterior and interior_ They have the standard sushi rolls and some really interesting sushi as well_ Things I've never seen in even higher class places_ The sushi was fresh and robust_ Good portions on the rolls as well_ The service was very good_ Our waitress was very attentive and so sweet, she always had a smile on her face_ I highly recommend this place_",)
