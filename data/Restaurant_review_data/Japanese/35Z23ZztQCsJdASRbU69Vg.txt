I am definitely going to give this place another try because I do understand they are just starting out and because the price was right for the experience",)("Was not a fan of the sushi, most of it was not fresh and pretty gross_ Wouldn't go back here again_",)("I was so disappointed by this place_ I usually love revolving sushi bars but this place really let me down_ \n\nFirst, when we arrived (there were 5 of us), they ushered us to a table that was too small despite having plenty of tables that could fit us_ Once we were sat, a server didn't come by to get us drinks or let us order off the menu for over half an hour_ When the server did come by, it took him another 15 minutes to get our drinks, half of which he forgot_ He also never brought the food that we ordered off the menu, and gave us a hard time when we wanted it taken off the bill since we never received it_ \n\nAs for the revolving sushi itself, I'm not sure if we were there at an off time or what, but there was only like five or six things to choose from, all of which tasted pretty sub-par_ One sushi roll (the caterpillar roll) had three or fours little hairs in it, which was really off-putting for me_ Like I said, I don't know if it was just an off time, but it wasn't good for us at all_ It tasted very poor quality, and I honestly like the sushi from the grocery store more_ The server also neglected to bring us additional eel sauce_ \n\n It is pretty inexpensive, but for the service and quality we received, it still wasn't worth it_ I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't_ I am hoping it was just an off night for them and that this isn't the standard_ \n\nPersonally, I would not recommend this place - you're better off with grocery store sushi_",)("First off let me say I am a big fan of sushi and eat it all the time_  A year ago or so when this moved into the area I was not sure what to expect, I mean sushi + conveyor belt = not sure_  I was presently surprised by the quality, which I would attribute to how quickly the turn it out they have the buying power due to quantity I guess_  Given its not a high end sushi place but for the price and the speed its a great place for lunch for a busy professional_  I am a big salmon fan so that's the way I judge a place and they have good salmon_  I am able to get in and out in 15 min for about _8-11 full of good sushi and get back to work_  \n\nHere are a couple of things I have found frequenting the place over the last year or so_  Arrive early 11:30ish so you don't have to wait (noon you will have a wait and parking is a nightmare at that complex)_  Also this means all the sushi is freshly cut and prepared_   Avoid using conveyor belt mid afternoon or late lunch just order from the bar and they will prepare fresh_  All and all I love this place and would recommend it to any sushi loving busy professional_  \n\nThere are a couple of things that need to be improved although they don't keep me from going there at least once a week and probably after this review because now I am craving it_  Staffing needs to be increased especially on Fridays it gets hectic_  This would improve the experience and also allow them to turn tables faster as lots of days I am there an extra 5 min with people waiting for my spot because the staff is running around and cant close me out_  This will help with wait times also_\n\nCheers!",)("If you're looking for a quick, pop-in, pop-out sushi place that will fill your stomach without emptying your wallet, Teharu is your spot_ The center of the restaurant is the primary food preparation area, surrounded by a constantly-moving conveyor belt filled with tasty food! The plates are yellow(ish tan), green and blue, and the color of your plate corresponds to the price of the item upon it (_1, _1_50 or _2_plate)_ They offer a variety of both cooked and raw rolls, along with other items like gyoza, cucumber salad and desserts_ Because everything is ready as soon as you arrive, Teharu is convenient, though as anticipated for _1-_3 per item, the quality is pretty middle of the road_ That said, it's still A-OK, and it won't break the bank!",)("So sad!! So so many fruit flies I'm guessing_ Landing on our food_ I then went to pay my bill after the manager saw the dead one on my plate_\nShe just quickly picked it up and told me that the entire strip has them and that there is nothing she can do?",)("Everyone on here giving a negative review needs to get a grip_ Who cares if the waitresses aren't fluent in English?! It's a cheap sushi bar, and great! You can't expect gourmet rolls for _1_50 a plate_____but they taste just as good at RA or anywhere else! Best date night place because it's so cheap and fun! You can also order rolls that you don't see on the conveyer_ Cool 2003-2009 yrs_ music is always playing too_ Super catchy fun ambiance!",)("I come here often and I have visited other revolving restaurants__ This one is still my favorite there is a wait most days but once you sit down everything is quick and multiple waitresses and waiters attend to you_ It's a great deal for ok sushi__",)('One of my favorite sushi places in Scottsdale_ It is conveyer belt style and they only serve a limited amount of sushi at a time on the belt so it is definitely fresh_ The plates are small-you get about 4 pieces of sushi on each plate and the plates range from _1_00-_2_00 each_ I have brought several friends & family members here and they all love it_',)('So happy that this opened in my neighborhood!! Minimally decorated space with a large sushi bar and a few booths_ It was very busy at lunch but moved smoothly_ The sushi was replenished regularly_ Everything tasted quite fresh_ There was a nice variety of rolls (caterpillar, Vegas, Dragon) and nigiri with very fresh tasting fish_ The staff was very pleasant and attentive_ The price was fantastic_ The plates range from _1 to _2_ Loved that the plates all had clear plastic covers_',)('Been going to the location near Warner in Tempe, but am super glad they opened up a location near my work, and right near my grandparents_ Great prices for decent sushi on the go!',)("8:30 on a Friday night, no food in the house_ Starving_ Thanks for the tip yelpers! This place is awesome! The food is really good, the price is amazing and you're eating 30 seconds after you sit down_ \n\nThe rolls are great and there's lots of variety_ We topped off the night with mochi ice cream_",)("For starters, if you're going in expecting high-quality sushi, this probably isn't the place for you_ Their fare is average AT BEST, but with that said, it's still pretty good and hardly puts a dent in your wallet_ I can exit with a full stomach for generally around _12 (including tip)_ \n\nThe staff is very kind and friendly_ With that said, they have some serious understaffing problems at times_ There will be one poor girl in charge of taking care of 10+ people_ It's not an ideal situation, but it's hardly the end of the world_\n\nThe conveyor belt is a cool aspect and makes it easy to come in, sit down, and start eating_ For those seriously worried about the food quality, I've been there 30 + times and never experienced any issues whatsoever_\n\nIf you're craving sushi but don't want to spend an arm and a leg, I highly recommend this place_ But temper your expectations a little___",)("It pains me to give them such a mediocre score_ The food is great_ The sushi is fresh and has great flavor_ The reason for the low marks is the service_ They don't have a clue about running the front of the house_ When I walk in there, I actually fell my stress level spike because the staff runs around scared like chickens with their heads cut off_ They don't have servers, bussers, hostess, cashiers, everyone does everything and that is why the place is so chaotic_ We ordered off the menu and the food simply never came_ I didn't think it would since the waitress_busser_window washer_ gardener took my order and immediately went to buss a table and never visibly called my order to the kitchen_ They were nice though when I told them it never came, they eventually they gave us a meal to go for free and discounted our bill_ Nice people, good food, but the service is chaotic_ This was not a one-off event either_ I have been there about a dozen times and it is always the same poor service_",)("After eating at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Seattle several years ago, my husband and I were excited to see one in Scottsdale_ Teharu Sushi did not disappoint_  The sushi was fresh and tasty_ The prices are great!!  We went on the first Friday night they were open, so I'm very willing to forgive a few faux pas_ The major issues were the lack of organization for arriving guests and the lack of engagement of the staff_ Again, I get that they are just opening, so I'm sure they will settle into better customer service_ The staff members were very nice even though it was obvious they were stressed_   Overall, good food, low prices and pleasant staff are enough to get 4 stars from me today_",)("I love love LOVE this place! The sushi is fresh, delicious, and even though they are crowded most of the time they work fast at getting you in_ Don't expect this to be the best sushi out there, but being a big time sushi eater I'm very satisfied with it and it's a perfect place for me to go to because I get sushi several times a week_ I can be full here for _12 instead of paying _40 elsewhere! Can't wait to go back again soon_ So yum and the service there is great too!",)
