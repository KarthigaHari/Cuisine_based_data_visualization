we couldn't be accommodated at 7:30, but they could get us in at 8, or maybe a few minutes earlier_ We showed up around 7:40 and in this huge restaurant with seating for probably 100, there were maybe 20-25 people_ If they couldn't get us in at 7:30, at merely 25% capacity, because _they couldn't provide the best dining experience possible,_ as they claimed, then I can't imagine how they could ever handle a full restaurant_ Regardless, we were seated right away and chose seats at the kitchen bar, to be able to watch the chefs in action_ Our server came over and explained the restaurant concept to us and how ordering worked_ I won't explain, since many others have already, but we both chose the 4-course chef's choice_\n\nI won't run through all the dishes but, in brief, all of their food with the exception of one fish course and one dessert lacked flavor_ Everything from the amuse straight through to the end was so one-dimensional___the flavor profile was so narrow___absolutely no depth of flavor_\n\nAfter our first course, the manager came over and asked how everything was_ We were honest about how bland everything was, and he said, _Let us try this course again for you__ They did, and when he returned to see if this was better, we said yes because, at this point, we felt bad complaining about the food any further___but it wasn't_\n\nWe were very disappointed with our meal, especially after Seftel's glowing review and the great Yelp reviews_ We spent much time speaking with the manager, who seemed to care genuinely about our feedback, rather than just indulging us in listening to our opinion_ Posh is lucky to have such a great manager_ He explained that he wasn't making excuses but that, due to the nature of their concept, they do have off nights where they look back the following day and say, _That menu didn't really work__ He also explained that they don't follow a minimalist or _blandness_ credo, per se, but that the chef doesn't want to throw out anything that will scare the diners, since people won't think to put _No sea urchin_ on their card when they order_ I understand this, but I think people who come to this type of place are fairly adventurous diners to begin with_ Not only that, but you don't have to be too wild to give flavor_ A little seasoning on the lamb and duck, a nice port wine reduction or orange glaze___give me SOMETHING to excite my palate!\n\nThey ended up taking 10% off our bill and I think they gave us a little bigger dessert, thoughtful gestures that further conveyed their commitment to customer satisfaction_\n\nAs we were leaving, the manager said, _You know, with prices like ours, we can't really afford to have off nights or people won't come back and we'll be here two or three more months_ But I really hope you'll come back and give us another chance__ Because he was so nice and because I really want this place to survive and do well, I'd love to give them a second shot_ I just don't know if I can justify another _100 meal with the risk of it being off the mark when I can be assured of a stunning meal at Noca or other foodie destinations for the same cost_\n\nI thank Posh for their excellent service,

Because it is an awfully expensive wine pairing, they overcompensate by pouring a full glass with each course_  A full pour times 8 courses can be a bit much for lesser mortals_\n\nI've dined here twice, enjoyed it both times and would return if the opportunity presented itself again_",)("An adventurous joy_ Posh was a sensory delight and left me wanting to return soon_ \nI sat counter-top, and was able to watch the chefs prepare dishes throughout the evening_ The wine list is adventurous and unique_ The service polished and unobtrusive_ The food was inventive and perfectly prepared_ Everything about the evening was wonderful, from the moment we walked in the door to chatting with chef_owner Josh at the end of the meal_ \nA perfect date night, or great place to take someone while looking to impress_ I'll be back soon_",)("This restaurant is in my TOP-5 favorite restaurants of all-time!  ___The only reason I am not giving it 5-stars is because it is a real splurge, and it takes a pretty special occasion (and experience) to justify such an expensive meal_\n\nWhile in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and _deliciousness_) of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary, it wouldn't rank at all_\n\nYou really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though_  If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get_  \n\nIt can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan_  \n\nAlso, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill_\n\nFor the best experience, don't go when you are famished, and don't bring picky eaters with you - both will interfere with you having a completely satisfying experience_",)('Ramen night was overrated, just like the regular dining experience I had at Posh in the past_ The broth was over flavored, too oily, too salty, and overall too rich_ The reason ramens, or any good Asian noodle soups for that matter, are so delicious is because they are simple, satisfying and not too fancy_ This place, not so much_',)("If you are into something different, you must visit this restaurant_ I have a 5 course meal and I really enjoy all this _improvice_ courses_ You just need to scratch from the menu the ingridients that you don't like___ Then the chef will prepare you _something_ with the rest of the ingridients_ This experience was really enjoyable_ I definetly recomend this restaurant to others_",)("We did the 5 course with wine paring early on a Wednesday night_ The place already had a couple of tables going and some food bloggers filming at the open kitchen_ You can see the chefs working from every table in the restaurant but if you want to chat with the chefs ask for a seat at the open kitchen area_ \n\nThe 2 of us had different courses with different wine pairings_ I started with an amuse bouche, followed by popcorn soup, raw fish salad, kangaroo, quail and an ice cream lollipop_   My husband had lamb which was a little overdone and they replaced this immediately with some fabulous veal cheeks and an extra wine paring\nThe outstanding courses were the veal cheeks, kangaroo, quail and a raw fish salad_  \n\nThe wine parings were good and well synchronized with the food, no waiting and good sized pours_  \n\nOK  what is with the bread???

I shouldn't leave a dining experience feeling dehydrated_\n\nThird course was a take on Vietnamese Pho with frog legs as the protein_  The server said _it's made with Thai basil!_ like that was some kind of rare exotic ingredient_  The broth was decent, though many valley Pho restaurants would put it to shame_ One issue was they loaded it with the basil, so that became the dominant taste and aroma_  The pieces of frog legs were unseasoned and overcooked, making them tough_ The accompanying noodles, I believe they were rice noodles, were cooked correctly, however_\n\nMy fourth course was quail_  Once again, overly salty and a bit on the dry side_  It was overcooked to the point that the legs and wings were crunchy_  Nothing to write home about_\n\nThe final course was dessert_  And it was plain everyday flan_  Though they try to fancy it up by calling it _creme caramel__ That's right, a caramel custard that would have been at home in any average Mexican restaurant_ Absolutely nothing creative here and I think that's my main issue with Posh_  I expected to be wowed by the presentation and the combining of ingredients that you don't see every day_  Instead, I got a pedestrian tour of average valley restaurants and for that, I had the privilege of paying _88_00 (one _14_00 drink,tax and tip included)_  The flavors and presentation are something you would see at any average restaurant_\n\nI wanted to have a magical, show-stopping, special effects driven dining experience and that is what I had been lead to believe would happen at Posh_  Instead, I got a few cheap street show cards tricks and my pockets picked_  I will not be back_",)("Since I don't live in Scottsdale, it was a tad bit hard to find but well worth the adventure_ I've never experienced improv cuisine and it was such a fresh approach to dining_ It's like surprising your palette at each turn as you just don't know what the next course unveils but you know it's going to be spectacular nonetheless! It is definitely not for the price conscious so be prepared to part with your change_ Portions are on the smaller size but it was perfect as you don't leave feeling stuffed or heavy_ Parking is solely valet and is underneath the restaurant_",)("Definitely a Special occasion restaurant because the price, but if you are a foodie or pretty much up for anything you should dine here at least once in your life_  It's a great date night too because your date will get 6 different courses from you, so you really get a feel for the talent of the chefs and get to try a lot of food!",)("Great concept and outstanding food_  Our service was fabulous_  My water glass was always filled and our waitress Katrina was extremely helpful_  Diners should go in with an open mind_  Each course is a surprise so if you don't like surprises you will probably be stressed out during dinner_  My wife is a picky eater and not overly adventurous and she absolutely loved it_    Enjoy!!!",)("Four stars for effort for sure to bring some kind of pop-up semblence of da real deal ramen_ But unfortunately the end result lacks authenticity and is embellished far beyond necessity which allows me to only muster up 3 stars_ \n\nPros: \n-Hubby took away all preconceptions and stated that the okonomiyaki deserved praise for sticking to the simple ingredients and a sauce on par with the basic Otafuku found in any nihon-jin's repertoire_\n- The ramen noodle quality which is curly egg, was above average and likely an aspect the chef took time to research and import to Posh_ Easily similar could be found in many LA joints_\n-The onsen tamago was perfectly poached and runny, kudos for getting this basic formula right where others fail here, a deal breaker for those like me who shriek when we see the hard boiled variety_\n-Charsiu was great quality pork belly sliced on the vertical as opposed to the rounded product_ Chef took their time to roast this carefully producing tender albeit slim and few pieces to adorn the bowl (_4 extra steep price tag so be warned!)\n\nCons: Way way wayyy too many toppings that my ramen got lost underneath a full bed of all kinds of peppers, and the sad part was the broth resulted in a overwhelming pepper parade on the palate_ \n\nNet net: Not bad Posh, could improve for sure (tonkotsu challenge??)___or one cld just order plain with charsiu and the egg solo_",)("Went months ago but finally getting around to writing this bugger_ While it's a bit on the pricey side, it's well worth the trade-off!

This was just a bit too small -when you are serving wagyu or kobe beef that are very rich with fat, it makes sense to serve a tiny portion, but with regular beef, there's not a good reason to be so skimpy!) \n\nThe desserts were just okay - a dulce de leche flan and a white chocolate mousse with a raspberry gelee_ They tasted well enough, but they weren't really up my ally texturally - both were very mushy and neither had anything crunchy_crispy_cookie-y with them_ \n\nI ordered a mocktail at the start of the meal - a fruity pomegranate soda_ It was good - very sweet, but good_ However, one of my first dishes included a garlic chip, which the server had described as a sunchoke chip_ I took a large bite of it, and while I don't mind garlic, it meant that I was tasting garlic for the entire rest of the meal! I had a hard time drinking the very sweet soda as it didn't combine well with the garlic flavor_ Also, a warning - three of our dishes included garlic chips of some sort_ \n\nNow, this last bit will sound nitpicky and weird, but it totally impacted my experience: the silverware is really BIG!

It is a lovely restaurant and the service was great!

I wasn't really feeling that at all_ Nonetheless, the wines chosen were good wines and I enjoyed each one, particularly the last one, a Black Moscat_ The server kindly wrote it down for me, I intend to try to find it_\n\nThe service was fantastic, attentive and non-intrusive_ Pacing was also great_ \n\nOverall, despite my truly awful shrimp chorizo, I really am looking forward to returning to Posh!!

Here's the thing, they've got something entirely affordable going on every Tuesday night_  Don't worry, you can still get their regular menu on Tuesdays_  But if you're looking for something different and more affordable, welcome to Tuesday Ramen Night_  I've been to Posh twice before but I had absolutely no idea they had this_  But just like their regular menu, the Ramen night dishes are phenomenal_\n\nJosh Hebert and his staff have gained a well deserved reputation for being daring with their cuisine and keeping their customers guessing with each visit_  If you're coming here for their typical menu, you'll be wowed by the dishes the staff whips up using just a small set of ingredients as a baseline_  After you select those ingredients, you're at the mercy of the chefs to come up with dishes they think you'll like_  Trust me, they know_  In the two previous visits I've had here, I've been dazzled by the creativity and combinations of flavors they put together_  That said, its definitely a special occasion restaurant as the total tabs can run well into the hundreds of dollars_  One way to avoid these prices is to come here during Arizona Restaurant Week, when they offer significant discounts for their usual fare_  If you don't want to wait for the Restaurant Week discounts in May or September, might I suggest Tuesday Ramen Night?\n\nA little background on this_  Amongst Josh's culinary travels, one of his stops on his journey was Japan, where he honed a number of Japanese cooking skills including (apparently) a variety of ways to cook Ramen dishes_  The Tuesday Ramen menu includes a variety of Ramen noodle dishes, but also some things you wouldn't expect_  \n\nCase in point, an appetizer my friend and I shared tonight called Okonomiyaki_  This my friends is a GIANT veggie pancake topped with shrimp, bacon, dried tuna, and a BBQ and mayo sauce mix_  My friend described it as hangover food on steroids_  I tend to agree, but in a good way_  Great texture and the barbecue sauce gives it a great kick_  For the Ramen bowls, I went with the Miso Ramen_  Smoked pork, veggies, and noodles in a fantastic broth_  And like the Okonomiyaki, huge in portion_  I got through all the noodles and veggies, but there was just too much broth for me to take down myself_  My friend got the Shrimp Ramen with shrimp, scallops, calamari, and scallions_  Super spicy though, so I shied away from that one this time_  My friend was stuffed, but I decided to get a chocolate mochi for dessert_  It was just one ball of mochi but came with some seasonal fruit and whipped cream_  Tasty, but mostly forgettable_  Total cost for the two of us for the Okonomiyaki, two ramen bowls, the mochi, two Japanese beers, tax and tip came to _70 (or _35 for the two of us)_\n\nSo there you go_  A __ price night at an otherwise ____ priced restaurant_  A really unexpected treat at an already solid restaurant_  I still recommend trying the regular menu when you have the chance (and the money)_  But on Tuesday nights, Ramen night at Posh makes for a fun, affordable night out with some great Japanese street fare_  One other thing, sit at the bar_  Watching and conversing with the chefs while they do their thing in the kitchen is culinary entertainment at its finest_",)("Overpriced, Overhyped and underwhelmed! I was terribly disappointed with my experience_ The food wasn't awful, but it was uninventive and one note_  I felt like they were trying too hard to be cute and trendy, rather than focusing the flavor and providing a balanced meal_  Also while I understand that a true improvisational cuisine is hard to accomplish with a restaurant that size,  it was pretty clear they had a set menu for the night and just rotated it between the tables_ For example, I noted in my restrictions _Vegetarian, eat dairy LOVE cheese__  I was served no dairy what so ever_  By my third course I complained because so far my food had been mediocre, and round 3 tasted like a stew, everything was cooked in the same broth_  Not to mention I couldn't cut through the asparagus with my knife or my teeth! \n\nThe server was great, when I complained she had them make me a new course, parmesan risotto_ It was better, but not creative and definitely didn't have a _wow_ factor_    She also brought us out a nice cheese plate on the house, which was by far the best part of the meal_ Overall, I was very impressed with the service and completely underwhelmed by the food_    I have no problem paying ___ for a stellar meal, but not for one that left me hungry and craving protein! We won't be back_",)("Was so excited to finally try POSH last night with friends and sadly, the company was really the best thing about the meal_  Unfortunately for POSH I had eaten a truly amazing meal just the prior evening at Binkleys so Chef Hebert had a LOT to live up to after that_  Yes, it's exciting to have no idea what you'll be eating as the night progresses, and we were open to trying just about anything_ \nToo bad that even after the dinner I'm still not sure what we ate because our server was so brand new (day #4 and her first day was ramen night) that she was very limited on her descriptions_  It would seem that a mentoring system would be best for getting such involved food to diners so they can better appreciate the ingredients and techniques that went into preparing each course_ \nAlthough in general I enjoyed my meal, I have to comment on the over-use of salt on many items served to my dining companions_ The fish served was so over salted I'm not sure how my friend was able to finish his plate_  Another problem was food temperature_ I get that the 62 degree egg was not served piping hot, but a couple other courses seemed as though they should have been warmer and we're just weren't , possibly due to waiting around for other items to be prepared before being served_  \nLastly, maybe it's time for a change for Chef Hebert_  With an open kitchen it's hard to hide when the head chef looks completely disinterested_bored_tired throughout service_  Probably a reason I felt disinterested_bored_tired by my meal_",)("My husband and I went to Posh last night for our anniversary_ We both agree that it was the best meal we've ever eaten_ I had Kangaroo as one of my meals which I can't believe but everything I had was just so delicious_ We did the 4 courses which was plenty for us_ We each ordered a drink_ Our total was about _132 which is pricey but it was SO worth it_ \n\nThe concept is so much fun!

A combination of poor execution, terrible service and unimpressive flavors_\n\nNow not everything is terrible_ I actually quite enjoyed my Goma Ramen, served with an additional soft egg_ Having the egg in the soup should not be an _extra_ add on but an important component of the soup: opening the egg and letting the yolk flow out allows the broth to become creamier and elevate the entire flavors of the dish_ The base broth of the Goma Ramen was pretty mild and tasty, but the Shoyu broth literally tasted like watered down soy sauce: a dark water full of salt_ My Goma had great pork belly pieces and the piece of pepper was crunchy  and a little spicy, while the Bok Choy was waay overcooked and placed like a large piece, impossible to eat even with my best chopstick skills_ I enjoyed the thicker ramen noodles and I did not hesitate to add some squeezed limes to my soup, regardless of my server's strong disagreement for my order_\n\nThen Posh decided to inaugurate the internet-crazed new invention: the Ramen burger_ For those of you unaware of the newest cronut replacement, the ramen burger replaces the regular buns on a burger with cooked, egg-added and fried-into-patties ramen noodles_ At _15 we were all excited to give this craze a shot, so much so that 4 of us got the burger and the remaining 3 stuck to the soup_\n\nThe famed Ramen burger was about the size of a large slider, using a fried scallop in lieu of a beef patty_ The concoction was served alongside a small potato salad which my friend's were raving about_ Unfortunately, those 4 cooked pieces of potatoes were better than the star of the dish itself: the ramen buns were oily, the scallop was overcooked and the thickness of it was not consistent between the diners at our table_ The famous ramen burger fell short and left our peers ready to make a McDonalds run_ I shared some of my ramen with them and that kept them content for the remainder of the evening_\n\nMaybe harder to accept the fact that our pent up excitement about this place had died down, was the sad realization that the service was below awful_ We kept looking around for our server, had to keep reminding him to bring us more water (about 4 times when we were lucky enough to see him near our table) and had to send our requests more than once before we could get it_ I saw another server passed by and exchanged glances, having her clearly see me and hear _excuse me can we get some more water please?__ She smiled back and kept walking_ Hey, Thanks_\nEven worse than that, our soups came out but we had to wait about 5-10mins before the ramen burgers came out, leaving our burger eaters there waiting while we already had our food_ One burger didn't come out for 30mins_ We later found out that it was because they had miscalculated the orders and had ran out of the prepped food to make his burger_ Understandable mistake but maybe he should have told him as soon as the mistake was identified and not 30mins later when his food arrived (and we were already done eating ours)_ They didn't charge him for the burger, thankfully, as he didn't quite enjoy the taste of it when it finally came_\n\nSo, is there any silver lining with Posh? Absolutely_ Two of our peers have attended Posh on a regular night and truly loved it_ Unfortunately, their street eats disappointed and makes foodies like me worried about spending more cash at a place that fell so short from expectations_",)("I can only give my opinion of their monthly Wednesday late night menu, so take this for what it is; I've not been here for lunch or dinner_\n\nExcited to find out about their uber secret, (monthly?) late night ramen gathering, five or six of us decided to make an evening of it_ Starting out with one of their Gin cocktails was a delicious decision, and I sipped on it while sharing a couple of items from the menu_ I like cabbage and was excited to try out the Okonomiyaki; a grill top  cooked 'pancake' of cabbage, a few other add ins, topped with super tasty sauce, bacon, and a few other items, sans the shrimp cause of an allergy, it is worth ordering again_ We shared an ordered a the Goma ramen, pretty tasty, similar to other ramen, but notably better_ Unfortunately there were a few hangups with the order, some holier than thou service from the waiter that evening, and issues refilling drinks_\n\nAfter the meal I chatted with the chef for a minute or two, he told me they were thinking about doing their Ramen menu during lunch soon, but I haven't seen it happen just yet_ Overall the experience was fun but that was mostly from getting to watch the chef cook and hanging with our friends!\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix_",)("We visited recently, and this was about our fifth visit, although we have not been for a few years_  Was really disappointed_  While it's never truly been _improv_ cuisine and more of a rotating menu, this visit will probably be our last_  We selected the Omakase, which should be chef selection of the best_  Since you don't choose your dishes, isn't it always Omakase?  Therefore, I expected this to be really something special_  Instead of anything special, we basically just got a few more courses, and certainly nowhere near anything to justify the _175 pp price tag_  For 7 courses, I believe it was _80, and then it jumps up to the Omakase for _175_  That indicates to me that you will be _wowed_ by the food_  Even if we were to look at it as many more courses (some Chef's Tastings can certainly go up to 20 courses), we definitely did not have 14 courses each, which would justify the price somewhat_  It was just a few days ago and it would take some thinking to remember each dish that was served - so that shows the impression it made_\n\nI wouldn't really want 14+ courses, but I would have expected our dishes to be something special at the very least_  The table of four next to us had exactly the same courses that were were served between the four of them, with each of them having the 6-course meal_  As I mentioned, there was nothing _special_ or even tailored about this meal_  For example, you are asked to choose your meat and fish preferred temps_  We both selected _raw__  We each had two fish courses, both fully cooked, neither anything fantastic_  They had uni on the list that night and it was the only protein we were not served_  So basically, they list the proteins they have that night on the card_  You select anything you don't like, but they definitely have set dishes they are making - not much _improv__ Which is fine for the normal dining charge at Posh, but not the Omakase price_  \n\nFor Omakase, it's just a few more courses at an extremely bumped up price_  We did get a cheese plate - which is normally an extra _12 in addition to courses - but that was it, a tiny cheese plate_  No foie, which is another _extra_ you can select_  For _175, I would have expected both of the extra plates_  The dishes themselves were a mix of very good and meh_  Nothing that was so incredible that I have to eat it again_  There was even one fish dish that neither of us liked (we often had the same dish, which is unusual at Posh for two diners) and we barely ate it_  The server did not even acknowledge it by asking if it was ok_   It was close to _600 at the end for two Omakase dinners, three drinks each, and tip_ I honestly felt ripped off when I left_   I am really disappointed - this was one of my go-to's for a special evening out, and certainly not what I had hoped for as an anniversary dinner_",)("We love this place!

Not even a standard 3-ounce portion? My girlfriend had even less with her venison - maybe 1 1_2 ounces in a parmesan broth alongside two baby fingerling potatoes_ The meats were cooked perfectly, so kudos to the chefs for getting that right_ But overall, it lacked depth of flavor_ Dessert was a buttermilk panna cotta with lavendar honey (missed any scent or flavor of lavendar) and a lemon cake with berry coulee_ Tasty, but knowing that was the end of the meal left my hunger unabated_\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the foie gras brulee with mixed berry reduction_ Paying the _15 premium was one thing; receiving a 3_16_ thick slice paired with sugar and berries was a total misstep_ Who pairs sugar & sweet berries with fatty foie gras?

The good news is, the owner has a new place called hot noodles and cold sake that recreated the ramen night they used to have - only every night_ Check it out_",)("Spent _400 dollars on the 7 course_  My husband had the wine pairing option with his_  Started off promising but my 2nd course was potato salad_  I didn't put that on foods I hate so my bad but it hardly had any taste except the lettuce was vinegar_  From there down hill_  Every course was bland food with semi fancy presentation_  The desert was good but not exceptional_  All 4 of us at the table (all 4 had the 7 course) were extremely disappointed and had spent a lot of money_  Maybe it was a bad night but their bad night was my expensive birthday dinner_",)("Being a fan of expensive and interesting cuisine, I have to say that this place is one of the few that in the food category get it right in Phoenix_ The concept of the customized menu and course selection is pretty amazing and certainly something you should share with out of town guests, or a great date_ The service was actually some of the best I've ever had in Arizona_ \n\nOn the downside, the decor is lacking and doesn't match the level of the food or service - a flaw in design for sure_ (For a _115 meal, I expect more than cafe decor and a a stinky bathroom with exposed plumbing issues_)",)("_Wow!_, I couldn't help but blurt that out after one bite into the Striped Sea Bass_ I have never tasted fish so flavorful with a light crispy layer_ Everything was outstanding_ Best of all, the Chef and staff were very friendly and didn't mind me taking pictures of every dish as it came out_ Best time to go is mid-week between 6-7pm, talk about great, friendly service!",)("I really wanted to like this place_  I was so excited_  I watch chopped, I'm always down to try weird foods, and I've been wanting to try a tasting menu for a while_ I ended up disappointed_  \n\nI forget how many courses we ordered, maybe 5 or 6 or 7_  It doesn't really matter though, you order based on how many things you want to try not how hungry you are_  I could have had 5 more courses and still been hungry_  My group stopped at another restaurant earlier for drinks and appetizers, and I suggested that we go here for dinner_  \n\nThere were some interesting ingredients incorporated into the courses including uni, sweetbreads, quail, and others but for me the flavors mostly fell flat_  The only highlight of my meal was the dessert_  I had been looking forward to a nice creme brulee from the moment I walked through the door and smelled the burnt sugar_  Alas, someone else at my table got the creme brulee, and not I_  Still, the desert I got was quite good_\n\nUnfortunately, the dessert didn't make up for the rest of the meal_  I get that you're paying for an experience here (you sure aren't paying for quantity), which  was pretty cool in theory_  I just wish the food tasted better___",)('Came here for my birthday! Loved the food and the wine pairings_',)("Oh my Posh!\n\nThe service here was really great, so that's always a good start_ I enjoyed our food although both of our seafood dishes were slightly overcooked, and my fish was overseasoned_ The sweetbreads and kangaroo were both very well cooked and flavored_ The presentation was clean_ \n\nI'd say the name is a little bit misleading as it's not really _improvisiational__ To me, improv is just executing without prior thought_ Based on what we ate, and what we observed being delivered to other guests, you can tell they had set dishes_ \n\nI really enjoyed my dessert which was a piped pistachio cheesecake with puff pastry_ \n\nI'd probably go back again for Restaurant Week since it's cheaper, but not sure if I'd go any other time_  It was real, it was fun, but it wasn't real fun_",)('We just went there again_ Still love the concept ! good food_ Good service_ But the food was just good, nothing more, nothing less_ \nThe two of us had a five course menu, upgraded to foie gras _ Non of the dishes wowed us, most were good_ \nDefinitely something to try !',)("Awesome place and an amazing experience_ I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a special date, or anyone looking to be adventurous_ My girlfriend and I are both lacto ovo vegetarians who don't like mushrooms or olives, and yet even within those constraints they had very creative, very unique, and incredibly delicious courses for us to enjoy_ \n\nI'm only leaving 4 stars instead of 5 because we left hungry after 6 courses___their website does say _We want you to leave sated, but try not to stuff anyone or make anyone sick with too much food__ which I very much respect and appreciate, but the courses were just a little too small even with that in mind - both of us left still hungry enough that we snacked more as soon as we got home_ Perhaps because we ordered vegetarian the courses were particularly not-that-filling, so your experience may differ_ My advice is to go, just don't go starved :)",)("If you wake up one morning and ponder about where to go to get thymus gland, kangaroo, and_or quail then let me tell you my friend, Posh is your place!\n\nI made reservations to sit at the counter and I would highly suggest doing the same_ Interacting with the chefs and watching them cook and prepare each course is really neat and way better than any Iron Chef reality show_ Service was fantastic, everyone was nice and my water glass was always full_ We were given a starter consisting of a peanut sauce with ricotta cheese and a splash of coconut milk in a Japanese soup spoon_ That was followed by Pumpkin soup that was good, but nothing off the charts_ It reminded me of something I got from Trader Joe's_ My date received raw ahi tuna with a pear gelatin that was delicious_  My next course was a full deep fried soft shell crab with mushrooms and noodles_ HOLY CRAB, BATMAN____I have no words to describe the flavor party that occurred in mouth! I really wanted to take the crab out and take pictures with it, but I reminded myself that I am in a classy restaurant and that probably would have been frowned upon, but those would have been bomb-ass photos!\n\nMy date's next plate was sweetbread (yummy) that was served with a mustard sauce (that was okay) and cabbage_ The next course was kangaroo with delicious sweet potato puree (no seriously, I wanted some more of that for my desert plate)_  The kangaroos itself was fine, I'm not a big red meat eater and honestly couldn't tell the difference_ My date said it taste _gamier_ than beef (whatever that means)_ I specified that I didn't like raw meat so I'm wondering if maybe that would have made a difference_ Anyhoo, my date received quail stuffed duck (or maybe it was the other way around, hmm) that had a lot of spiciness to it_ In my opinion, too much spice as that was all my taste buds could focus on_ For dessert I received  some sort of creme brulee gelatin type that was delicious while my date received chocolate mouse with a homemade chocolate graham cracker that was the best part of the plate_ \nOur next treat was the plum_blueberry frozen lollipops that a previous Yelper had warned us all about and I'm not going to lie, I was a little hesitant to try it for fear my lip would be the next victim_ However, I'm proud to report that they must have learned their lesson because my lips along with my date's lips are A-OK_  Along with the bill, the restaurant gave us 3 little cookies in a bag which helped soften the blow___clever Posh, clever! \n\nMy date and I had a great experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for something new, but we are not sure if we would go back on a regular basis_",)("Came here for an early Valentine's Day celebration_ Got the 5 course meal (_70_person), but I believe it's cheaper if you come during happy hour_ Anyway, the food was above average, the service was great_ I guess I was expecting the best meal(s) I ever had___certainly wasn't that, but a fantastic experience nonetheless_",)("Okay, you guys_ I'm not a fancy eater_ I - apparently - am turning into a picky eater, the older I get_ This is not a good combination_\n\nBut do you know what is? Posh_ And ramen_ Together_\n\nI'm out in sunny Arizona escapting the Philly snow, and my friend brought me here_ At first I was all like, _Ramen like the bricks you get for _0_10?_ Nope_ This is the real deal_ The food was so good_ The wine was good_ The staff was good_\n\nI can't wait to find an excuse to go back_ You need to find an excuse to get there on a Tuesday_ ASAP_",)("We go every year on our spring break stay in Scottsdale_ This year was better than ever! Adventurous food, beautifully presented_ Loved it so much we went back for ramen night-also amazing_ Don't miss this place!",)("This place was AuhMazing_ My husband took me here for a surprise date night while we were staying in Phoenix for work_ We got the wine pairing which let me tell you was fully worth it_ The food was on point, they captured exactly what each of us liked with barely any information_ There wasn't a dish we didn't absolutely enjoy_ We sat at the bar area which turned out to be a great idea as we could chat with the chefs which made the experience even more special_ We will totally be back the next time we are in the area_",)
