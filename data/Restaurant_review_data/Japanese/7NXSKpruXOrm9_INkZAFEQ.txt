("I discovered this place while Yelping and I'm glad I did_ They don't serve junk food like the fast food chains_ The food is delicious and convenient_ Their bowls are the perfect size and not pricey at all (even better for students)_ You can get bowls or plates with chicken, rib eye, pork you name it! \n\nEver heard of food pong? Try it out_ Maybe you'll get a bowl for free! How awesome is that? Don't forget to get a punch card at the register_ Buy nine bowls and get the tenth bowl on the house!",)("I'm a big fan of Chix_  A healthy option for lunch and only _5 if you're an ASU student_  I prefer the white meat and brown rice, but that adds _1_50 to the tab, so I only get it every so often_  The mixture of the two sauces available with the meat and rice is an awesome concoction_  Definitely a good place to go!",)("Chix Char Broiled Grill is what made me what to get on yelp_ Why, you may ask? Because I think the establishment should be rewarded for its exceptional value_ The meat, rice, and vegetables are all delicious, high quality, and healthy_ Not to mention one only has to wait just a few minutes for the food_ Anyone who would choose eating at the Memorial Union over this place, unless of course you only have a minute before class, needs to take ECON 101 over again! For five bucks you are in and out (not to be confused with the burger joint), having just eaten a healthy, satisfying meal_\n\nCheck it out - I promise that you'll love it!",)("In short: Amazing fresh food, at a good price, and awesome customer service to boot_\n\nI went here by accident but probably the best accident ever, if there is such a thing_  It's unassuming and simple, even the menu isn't elaborated, I think 10 items total_  It looks like just another chicken bowl place, wrong!!! It's anything but that, the food was amazing_  They use really fresh ingredients, seasoning is perfect_  You don't get the cardboard chicken doused with teriyaki sauce like other places_  Texture and doneness of the meat was perfect_ I tried the combination plate which had rib eye beef , chicken, lots of vegetables, a slaw style salad and half an orange_  The portions are huge and filling, and  the prices are great too, and I love their emphasis on good healthy food_  This is great place for a fast lunch or a good healthy meal_",)("I can describe this place in four words: simple, healthy, delicious, and inexpensive!\n\nI love this place_ I'll start with the simple part_ You can either order plates or bowls_ The plates are the same as the bowls, but plus a side of salad and the fresh local fruit they have that day_ As for the structure of the bowls, you can get some combination of meat, vegetables, and rice_ For rice, you can choose between white and brown_ The vegetables are just an assortment of the standard vegetables_ The meat is either chicken or ribeye meat_\n\nOn to the healthy part: The rice is always steamed, never any oil, etc_ added into anything! No trans fats in any of their dishes! The meat is charbroiled, in order to maintain the oil-free thing_ The skin is removed from all of the chicken to reduce the fat content_ This is probably the healthiest option for food anywhere near ASU_\n\nDelicious: The sauce that they have is great_ I would say it's some kind of modification of a teriyaki sauce, and you can tell a lot of effort went into that sauce_ They only have the one sauce, but it is a great one_ They have a cajun-hot sauce on the side, also, in case you want to add a little heat, which I usually do_ \n\nInexpensive: The bowls are around _5_00_ They don't look that big, but because they are so healthy, they will fill you up_ \n\nThe first week I tried this place, I went back 3 times (3 days in a row)_ I cannot get enough of this place and I will be back soon_",)("From the looks of the place, you probably wouldn't have high expectations_  They have a very limited menu: rice (white and brown), veggies, beef, and chicken_  That's about it_  But, of what they do have, I will say: good flavor, good quality, cooked well and very reasonably priced_  _The Works_ plate I ordered was only _6_50 and it was huge_  The beef was rib-eye (one of the tastiest cuts of meat in my opinion) and it, along with the chicken, were perfectly grilled_  Not undercooked, not overcooked, tender and moist_  Also, I was impressed by the fact that they offered both white and brown rice_  Comparable places only offer white rice_  Sometimes, its those little things that make a difference_  \n\nIf you liked Mai Island Grill, but not the price, the crowd, the line, or their hours, then you will most likely like Chix_  Personally, if Chix added a tasty mac salad, I would say it would serve as a suitable replacement for Mai Island_",)("I was craving some charbroiled chicken with rice and decided to try this place out_ I had _the works_ bowl because I wanted chicken but upon arrival the beef was tempting me_ This way I can have both_\n\nI felt that the food was just alright_ The meat was cooked well but the flavor was lacking_ They had some louisiana hot sauce on the counter with the pump style dispenser for those who want to add a little spice_ It added some flavor to the meat but I felt Sriracha would've gone better with it_ \n\nPortions were good_ Price was very reasonable_ The guy at the counter was friendly and patient with me while I was deciding_ I would say it's decent food but wouldn't make any special trips for it_",)
