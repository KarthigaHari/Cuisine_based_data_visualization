Let me preface this review by saying that this is NOT a typical sushi bar, it is a gourmet Japanese restaurant, so if it's specialty sushi rolls that you're looking for, head to Geisha A Go Go or any of the other sushi spots that serve deep-fried, cream cheese laden, Americanized sushi as you will not find such fare here_  Rather, what you will find are some of the highest quality and most unique dishes that I can honestly say I've ever had paired with exceptional service_ \n\nWe decided to sit at the sushi bar, at which the manager had graciously reserved us prime seating_  My husband and I opted for the seven course chef's tasting as we've found that this is usually the best way to get a feel for what a new restaurant has to offer_  The courses that we had are summarized as follows:\n\n1_  Chilled asparagus soup - light and flavorful, left us looking forward to the courses ahead_\n\n2_  Scorpionfish carpaccio - the fish itself as well as the sauce it was served in had excellent flavor, I could have eaten a whole plate of this as an entree_\n\n3_  Sashimi sampler - a beautifully presented plate of six entirely different preparations of six different sashimis (including things we'd never had before such as giant clam and Japanese sea scallops), each having it's own unique flavors_  We watched this dish being prepared while we were consuming the first two courses and it took over 15 minutes just to prepare this one course_  The attention to detail and presentation was unbelievable!\n  \n4_  Steamed manilla clams with 5 types of Japanese mushrooms, served in their own broth - this dish actually derives its incredible flavor simply from steaming the clams and mushrooms together_  So delicious!\n\n5_  Foie gras wrapped in halibut - this Japanese _fondue-style_ dish was incredible!  Our waiter brought out bite sized pieces of foie gras wrapped in a thin piece of halibut and served on a pick with a variety of dipping sauces and then brought us each a wooden box which housed the flame that heated a paper-lined wire mesh basket containing sake and water in which we placed each skewer for approximately 30 seconds before eating_  The foie gras absolutely melted in my mouth!\n\n6_ Nigiri sushi - two separate plates (perhaps even two courses) of the highest quality Nigiri that I've ever had_  We inquired with the manager as to where the chef gets such high quality fish and were told that he has his fish flown in daily, which explains how such a small restaurant can have such amazingly fresh fish_\n\n7_  Japanese egg custard with fresh fruit - light, fluffy, and the perfect end to a perfect meal_  We aren't typically _dessert people_ and rarely order dessert at a restaurant, but this was delicious!\n\nThe chef's tasting that we had was _130 per person and without a doubt, was worth every penny_  We typically don't splurge quite that much when dining out and it would certainly be possible to order items a la carte and keep the cost to _50-_70 per person_  \n\nIf you've read any of my other Yelp reviews, I think it's apparent that I do not gush about mediocre restaurants and am probably a bit harsher in my reviews than most are, but I can honestly say that if it were possible to give ShinBay six stars, I would_  We will be back soon and often_  I'm so glad that we found this gem!",)("I've lived in Tokyo for 4 years and go back regularly for work and always enjoy the food, especially sushi_  I find it very hard to find comparable style food Stateside, but will say that Shinbay is just that_  The chef is from Japan and the food is absolutely phenomenal_  We had the chef recommendations and everything was fabulous (keep in mind that I have a taste for Asian foods)_  Great sake menu to boot_  Highly recommended if you have the wallet for it_",)("5 stars_ This place is no joke_ They do it right_ All of the food is fresh and delicious_ The service is great and the atmosphere is what you'd expect_ You have to be willing to surrender your will to the chef but I can assure you that its worth it_ We had no idea what was coming to the table but it was all awesome!

Oh except that this raw fish does NOT taste as good and that eating undercooked meat might lead to health risks!
