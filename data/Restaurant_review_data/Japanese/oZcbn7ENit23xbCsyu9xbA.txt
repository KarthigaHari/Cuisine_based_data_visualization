It hit the dessert spot!\n\nThey also have a new tapas menu to try smaller portions (at a very reasonable price)_ Lots looked enticing, but we had to pick and choose since we don't have bottomless stomachs! I must say, we made good choices and had good recommendations this recent visit_ For sure no disappointments!\n\nService was attentive and friendly_ \n\nWe always love coming here when we can!

itself is a little cramped for my liking, but it has a very cool, laid-back vibe_  The sushi chefs were busy chatting up a couple at the bar, talking about their favorite items on the menu and just making it feel even more pleasant_  Yasu makes me happy I moved to NE Phoenix_",)("I did not believe here was Phoenix during this visit_ Yasu served extremely great dishes for us especially sea bass of chef's special was very good_ I am surprised at their quality to cook this fish_ In addition their tempura should be one of the best tempura in US because actually they were not flitter but completely tempura like Japan_ But we ordered shoju named Kaido, at that time they filled only one finger depth on the glass with 9 dollars_ They should improve volume of shoju if they would get better reputation than current situation_",)('Amazing Black Ice t, Good Meso and edamamme_ Sushi was fresh and good quality__',)('Food was great_ Service lacking_ Sat at sushi bar_ Sushi chefs attentive but rest of staff a little amateurish_ I would go back but i was dissappointed in overall service',)("Another incredible meal at Yasu_  The waitress surprised me when I was too torn to decide amongst the plethora of choices_  Well done Madeleine_  One of the most fantastic pieces of fish I've ever experienced_  The dessert, the sushi, the service___all was sublime_  Thank you_",)("To date, the best sushi I've had in AZ, bar none_\n\nFresh and delicious_ \n\nThe rest of the Japanese menu is just as extraordinary, and the staff is helpful friendly and welcoming_ Not too stuffy either!\n\nOverall, one of the very elite restaurants in Arizona_",)("I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time with friends, and we were finally able to make it out last night_  Disappointment is a good way to describe the mood of the evening_\n\nI should note that we didn't actually order anything other than water, so this review does not contain anything about the food_  The experience was so unsatisfactory that we decided to leave for another restaurant_  I'm not against trying Yasu again, but I would prefer to go on a different night when perhaps the service would be better_\n\nUpon entering, the strong and distinct smell of bleach attacked our noses_  That was off-putting enough; a restaurant should smell clean, but it should also not smell of cleaning solution, especially one rated as highly as Yasu_\n\nIt took a few minutes for the server to notice and seat us, which wasn't bothersome even as slow as the restaurant seemed_  The restaurant itself is incredibly small, with only a few tables and bar seats available_  The kitchen is readily visible from just about any seat in the house, which I find kind of fascinating_\n\nThe menu was the first of a few pitfalls_  It is simply a vague list of items, most of which are denoted by their Japanese names_  No descriptions_  I'm used to going to sushi restaurants and needing to ask for descriptions of their rolls,  but I've never been to a restaurant that did not at least attempt to describe their main menu items_  When we told our server that we were still attempting to _decipher_ the menu when she came over to take our order (which seemed to take a really long time), she simply said _okay_ and walked back to the kitchen_\n\nI wish she had offered to help us decide what to get, but perhaps she was giving us our space_  At any rate, when she returned (after a lengthy chat with the other server working that evening), we had some questions for her_\n\nNow, this is where the evening really started to go downhill_  Whereas both of my friends were able to obtain satisfactory answers as to what was in the menu items that piqued their interest (save the menu of sushi rolls, for which we were only provided descriptions for their five most expensive rolls), I was less than satisfied_  \n\nI kindly informed our server that I am a vegetarian, and asked if she could give an overview of what I could order_  She immediately looked to the grill portion of the menu, initially suggesting something with scallops but musing to herself that the bacon probably wouldn't work_  Thank goodness one of my friends piped in and informed her that being vegetarian meant that bacon was not an option, and this is where the server finally seemed to grasp what we were saying_  _As in, just vegetables?_  She sounded surprised that someone would choose to eat _just vegetables_ on a daily basis_\n\nAt no restaurant have I ever been asked that question before when clearly stating my dietary needs, whether it's a McDonalds or a Fox Concepts Restaurant_  I expected something better from Yasu, which positions itself as a high end sushi restaurant in decor, ambiance, price, and menu selection_  A server should be aware of various dietary needs (not all, but the most popular certainly) and be able to recommend dishes that suit them without missing a beat_  That she could not was off-putting to begin with, but it managed to get worse_\n\nShe began hesitantly recommending dishes, but she was totally unsure as to what was actually in them_  A disclaimer on the menu disclosed that many sauces are made with fish oils, nuts, and soy, asking customers to disclose any allergies or dietary needs so the chef can accommodate them_  When pressed about the sauces for this very reason, the server was unable to tell me what was in any of them_  She thought the Japanese eggplant skewer had a flavored soy sauce with it, but had no idea what it was flavored with_\n\nI further disclosed to her that I was allergic to shellfish (I've found that sometimes servers are more serious when dealing with allergies versus dietary _choices_ such as vegetarianism or veganism), but that didn't help_  We ended up leaving to go to a restaurant that has a good selection of food for everyone, and we were happier for it_\n\nTo me, that level of service is unacceptable, and I haven't even detailed the time that we waited in between each server's visit to our table, but it was significant_  I feel that I should be able to go to a moderately high-end restaurant like this and feel confident that I won't order something that will make me sick_\n\nI'm sure the food is stellar_  I just also happen to have minimum standards for service_",)("Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu_ This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of _chain sushi_ places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu_ There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan! \nBest thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed_ \nThe area and building are misleading___ However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you_ This is real sushi___\nGo try and enjoy!",)('Really busy on the Saturday night we went___probably a good idea to get reservations_  But the staff was gracious and helpful and really knew their stuff_  The food was incredibly delicious_ I like the small plates so you can try a lot of different things_ The popcorn shrimp was awesome_',)("I don't have a pic, however, I loved the rolls here_ I had the smoked salmon, and a few other rolls_ The customer service was awesome the owner took my order he was patient and kind as I stumbled over the menu look for that right bit he helped decide_ I will be back!!",)("I've been to over 20 different sushi restaurants around the valley and this has been the best for me_ It's really simple,  they know how to properly make sushi_  Everything from the presentation to the cut, the chef pays attention to everything_\n\nEvery so often, they will have kobe beef flown in_ I would highly getting on their wait list_ The only negative I would give is that they need to have a website and update their menu_ Had the waitress deny 3 courses they were not ready with ingrediants_ Anyway, still the best sushi in the valley_",)('The absolute best Japanese cuisine in Arizona_  Yasu is a tremendously creative chef_  He is amazingly skilled at textural_flavor combinations (try the ankimo -monkfish liver pate - with tempura avocado), and the service is  as wonderful as the food_  I recommended this place to everyone_  This is a true hidden gem in Phoenix_   I am shocked that I found such amazing and authentic Japanese cuisine in Phoenix (better than Nobu at the Teeter House, Roka Akor, Hana, ShinBay, and all of the other _top tier_ Japanese restaurants in Phoenix, and as good as anything I have tasted in the U_S_ or Japan)_  You will not be disappointed_',)('Sushi and service were amazing! Valerie has great menu knowledge and made great recommendations_\n\nThe true reason for the 3 stars is the pricing_ I eat sushi all over as I travel for work and with some rolls at _18 it is a bit much_ Again food and service were great, but not sure of the cost_',)("Where do I begin to explain how awful this experience was_ The service was beyond bad_ We were given 5 or 6 different paper printed menus and could not figure out the dishes for anything_ The waiter gave explanations that were just too involved and frankly made us more confused_ What he didn't explain was that each overpriced dish was barely enough for one person_ And the prices were just ridiculous_ The raw fish was warm_ I would deem Yasu as one of those places, where if you go, you need to,eat first and bring lots of money_ But don't bother_ It's awful_ Just awful_",)("Recently, I have been to several major US cities, and in each one, I made it a point to find the best sushi I could, with varying degrees of success_  One of my friends asked me, _Why haven't you found the best sushi in Phoenix?_  Lack of urgency?  Needless to say, we began a quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix_  It will be an expensive quest_  And I think we started at the right place_\n\nWe started with the miso soup with clams_  If you want to imagine what miso soup with clam tastes like, imagine taking miso soup, and just adding clams_  I can't really think of any other way to describe it_  It's really that simple_\n\nWhen the waitress took our order, we basically just went to town_  And everything was brought out, for the most part, one at a time_  This gave us time to enjoy each dish, and have a few minutes to think about it before the next item arrived_\n\nThe first dish we had was the ankimo, or steamed monkfish liver_  This delicacy is something I had in Denver, San Diego, and San Francisco_  Here, it was served without ponzu jelly, but otherwise similar_  The others in my party, who hadn't had ankimo before, liked it_\n\nNext, we had hamachi carpaccio, which was a hit_  These perfectly garnished strips of yellowtail were one of the highlights of the night_\n\nAfter that, we had yellowtail tartare_  This got mixed reactions; I'm not sure what they used in the flavoring, but I did like the spicy note that slowly builds up after you eat it_\n\nWe then had the amaebi sushi (shrimp), which was served in two stages: first, the main part of the body, peeled and raw; and finally, the head, deep-fried_  I had deep fried shrimp heads before, but it was a first for my two dining companions_  Really, the head is the most interesting part, and I would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head_\n\nNext was brought out a whole fried european sea bass_  This was one of the most passable items for me; I usually prefer my fish to be served raw_  It was a nice change from everything else, but I probably won't order that one again___ Or maybe I'm just bitter because the fish only had two eyeballs, and I didn't get one of them_\n\nWe then started on a rainbow roll, which the others ordered because they wanted to ensure we had something _safe__  I ate a few pieces, but I never really get excited about rainbow rolls, or really any rolls_\n\nNext they brought out the sushi: we had ocean trout, young yellowtail, and red snapper_  The waitress made sure to mention that they were served with garnishes and sauces, and were not meant to be dipped in additional sauce_  I liked that they were so serious about how the dishes are intended to be eaten; it really highlights the care they take in making the cuisine an actual art form, and not just something to stuff your face with_  My favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail, but all were good (and fresh)_\n\nAfterwards, we had one more sushi item: the foie gras sushi_  It's really difficult to describe the taste of foie gras; it is distinct, but not overwhelming_  It was delicious, and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept_\n\nFor our last dish, we had the cook make us something of his choice_  He personally brought it to the table, and explained what it was_  He made us avocado tempura wrapped in see eel, with foie gras on top_  As if the meal wasn't already awesome enough, this totally elevated it to a new level_  It may make me a snob, but there's nothing I like more than having a piece of art made just for me, and having the artist personally unravel it_  If you have any appreciation of cuisine as an art form, this is clearly the place for you_\n\nWe finished our meal with the UFO dessert, which is a disc-shaped pastry stuffed with red bean and battered in tempura, and topped with ice cream_  It was pretty good_\n\nNow, I have had some pretty good meals in my life, but if I were look back and consider which one was the very best, this one would definitely merit consideration_  It may not appeal to the fan of generic sushi rolls, but if you like trying new and interesting things, you're sure to find some potential here_  The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none, as far as sushi restaurants are concerned_",)('I personally have no clue why the amazing reviews_ For one they have 4 menus, its bizarre and unnessasarry_ Then they like got one of the menus in off white with like highlighter print and you cant even see the writing_ Dinner service is slow as it gets_ It took me an hour and a half to get 2 rolls and the last time 2 hrs for like 3_ \n\nThe fish itself is fresh, I had things there that were good and stuff that was not at all good_ Whoever cuts the fish has no experience clearly_ The slices are thick and cut in odd places_ The scallop carrpaccio was realy good and the yellow tail carpaccio was kinda gross and in huge thick chunks_ \n\nIf you can combine all four of your menus hire a few more servers or kitchen help, andtrain the dude who cuts blocks of fish this place has a solid foundation for success its just a few things that keep me un interested_ If I was invited here by a friend I might come back but I would not reccomend or elect to come back with out influence_ \n\nI dont talk like that??',)("Sat at the sushi bar; it was like sitting at a table alone, you can't see the fish to determine freshness, etc_, what I usually do at a sushi bar_  This is a very pricey place for what you get, the nigiri are smaller pieces than any place I've ever visited, and they are on the average _1 more_\n\nThere are quite a few other places in PHX that don't let you walk away hungry, serve excellent, fresh sushi and have a personable staff_  Yasu falls short on value and personable staff_\n\nIf you are interested in a trendy place with great atmosphere, and are unconcerned with cost, this is the place_",)("Hadn't been to Yasu in quite a while__why?\n\nIt's more than a sushi place - don't just order sushi_sashimi - it's very good, but they've got a lot of other really cool options on the 'cooked' side of the menu, too_\n\nSorry that I only got one pic - once everyone tasted the Bistro Green Beans, I couldn't get everyone to stay out of the rest of the dishes long enough to get pics_\n\nWe let the server make recommendations___and I don't remember what everything was, but it was all really good!

Because it was the best and most enjoyable dining experience I've had in a long time_ My boyfriend and I opted for an early Valentine's dinner and decided to go to Yasu since we had such a great time there back in November_ We both are a bit adventurous, so we decided to skip sushi and head straight for the Japanese specialties_ we started with a delicious plate of Kumamoto oysters_ They were served raw, on the half shell with a nice, light ponzu-type sauce that complemented the sweet, ocean flavors of the oyster_ \n\nOther highlights were definitely the char-grilled whole black snapper as well as the aji, spanish mackerel_ The black snapper came out first (food is served as it becomes ready)_ It was perfectly cooked and picked up wonderful flavors from the grill_ The skin was crispy and added a nice layer to the seafood_ I tapped into my inner Anthony Bourdain and sampled both the cheeks and eyes of the fish, which was served head-on_ Cheeks were so good: very tender and sweet_ I'll probably skip the eyes next time as they did nothing for me_ \n\nNext was the Aji, which was served sashimi style with the head, tail and spine on the place_ The server instructed us, in very broken English, that when we were done with the meat, they would deep fry the rest (head, tail, bones) and we could eat that, too_ I wasn't sure I heard her correctly, but low and behold, when we finished with the amazing sashimi, she collected the remains and about 5 minutes later, returned with a plate of fried fish carcass_ Our eyes lit up and we dove in, pulling off pieces of fried bone, tail_ And it was delicious_ It tasted like fried chicken skins_ \n\nYasu is a small, little Japanese restaurant, where you are often seated in close quarters, so it's nice when you have neighbors who share your spirit of adventure_ Luckily we did_ Our neighbors opted for fish cheeks and a different preparation of Aji_ They said they were amazing_ \n\nAs for the service_ Last time we ate there it was very slow, but it was fun to sit there for a couple hours and really enjoy the food and ambiance_ This visit, our server was new and there were a few hiccups, but all were properly resolved and did not have any bearing on our overall experience_ \n\nThe owner was at Yasu and made a point of stopping by our table and talked to us for a while about food, the Olympics, life_ \n\nAlthough we didn't order the foie gras and eggplant this time, we had it last and it was so good_ Seriously just melts in your mouth_ The sushi also was amazing_",)('Excellent and authentic_ This is he best sushi in town_ I have tried many places and none have topped it_ You walk in and the setting is softly lit with perfect modern music playing_ Its very hip and a perfect date spot_ The food is so fresh_ They have the best eel here_ Its deliciously crisp and never too fatty_ Go here !',)('First and foremost, I am not into sushi_ I do love California rolls_ We stopped for lunch one day and had California rolls and there ginger salad_ The service was great and food was very tasty_ The atmosphere is inviting as well_',)("Yasu has great atmosphere_ Yasu has good service_ Yasu also has good sushi_ \nI'm not sure that there was anything remarkable about this place, but it is a quality place to go for sushi_ I think it's a little pricier than it should be_",)("The Customer is not always right at Yasu_ DO NOT BUY A GIFT CARD HERE_ Enjoyed the food, wanted to share the experience with a new client who just moved to the Tatum and Mountain View area, and bought them cards from several favorite restaurants_ Was told to keep my receipt in case of loss or theft_ What do you know? All the cards immediately disappeared from their basket while the movers were at the new home_ Rusconi's cancelled their card and issued a new one_ Yasu himself explained that they could do nothing (even though we reported it before they had opened for business and knew it was the only gift card sold that day___ they wouldn't call their provider_ Need a business gift___or a great helpful staff___go to Rusconi's_ Need a grumpy unhelpful proprietor___go to Yasu_ I won't make that mistake again_",)("I seriously doubted I would be able to find five star sushi in Phoenix_  I was wrong, wrong, wrong_  Yasu___what a pleasant surprise_  The place could be lost in a strip near a Target and REI, but once you walk in you are transported_  The decor is minimalist and soothing_  It's small enough to feel intimate but not crowded_  The sushi bar is small, with just four seats (two to a bench)_  It was a little odd to not be able to see through to the sushi chef's prep area, but in this case it didn't matter_  After the first bite we offered ourselves up to Yasu's expertise, deciding we trusted him completely_\n\nFrom the kitchen we had sake steamed Manila clams_  They were fresh and smooth_  The broth was light and buttery_  We also had the grilled scallop in bacon_  The scallop itself was huge, and braised to perfection_  But let's continue to the sushi!\n\nOur tastes are rather simple when it comes to sushi___no crazy rolls involving tempura, spicy anything or cream cheese_  Along with our standard tekka (tuna) and Kappa (cucumber) rolls, we did order a soft shell crab roll_  Well-done_  The rest of our items were either nigiri or sashimi: octopus, chu-toro, mackerel and salmon (be sure to get Yasu-style: just a touch of flame with ponzu, no need to dip)_  Specials included striped jack, fluke, and Kumamoto oysters_  All of the fish was high quality, fresh and expertly prepared_  The rice had a perfect consistency_  I think my favorite of the night was the fluke_  It was served with ponzu instead of soy sauce, allowing the light, subtle flavor to shine_\n\nThe chef, Yasu, and his assistant, Takeshi were helpful and very friendly_  They made sure to encourage us to ask if we had questions, and to make some suggestions_  Be sure to ask for fresh grated wasabi instead of the regular stuff_  Oh, and save room for dessert_  The green tea tiramisu was unreasonably, ridiculously delightful_\n\nI am thoroughly impressed with Yasu, and look forward to returning next time I'm in Phoenix_",)('If you are looking for quality sushi in Phoenix_Scottsdale this is the place_ This is hands down the best quality and best tasting fish I have had around here_ The menu is huge with lots of daily specials_ The staff knows what they are talking about and I had some very tasty Japanese beer_ Definitely more expensive then most places but worth every bite_ \n\nI would say the only downside is the food comes out a little slow_ I can handle that\n\n\nWill be back!',)("Figured we'd try this place out, it's in the neighborhood and had good reviews_    I was very disappointed_   \n\nIt wasn't too busy and we were quickly seated_ But that's all that was quick_ We ordered a couple of the specials and a few sushi rolls_ About an hour later we got our first roll_  We had to flag someone down to get wasabi and dishes_ 20 minutes later we said just cancel the tapas and bring us our rolls_   \n\nThe rolls were fine_ Nothing special, but I've probably had better from the grocery store_ The portions are very small_\n\nWe paid our rather large bill and stopped by Target to get some cold cereal since I was still hungry when I left_",)("To start, as soon as you walk up they're charcoal grilling kalbi out front and the aroma is amazing, I ordered the kalbi don and the marinade they use was delicious_ My boyfriend got their chirashi bowl which came with a fantastic variety of fish and also came with scqllops, shrimp and octopus which was a beautiful add_ We also tried the black pork gyoza skewers and soft shell crab, adorable presentation and absolutely delicious_ We'll definitely be coming back!",)("boooooom!!! Awesome service and fresh fish! They have some innovative dishes! Eel wrapped fois gras, fois gras eggplant___yes, I LOVE fois gras_ Great service and good wine list too!
