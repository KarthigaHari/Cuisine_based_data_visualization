('The food is quick and delicious, made with fresh whole ingredients_ For anyone in a hurry, can fill up fast without feeling guilty about it_ How often is that the case? The staff is wonderful- so polite and friendly_ Definitely above and beyond for an order-at-the-counter restaurant_',)('Great place- a little pricey, but It really works if you are craving a chicken bowl_ Staff is always friendly- especially Kevin_ I always enjoy having  a quick chat with him while my food is being cooked_ I go there about once a week, and my coworkers also go there about the same amount_',)("This is great tasty food_  It's not fast food but it is quick food_ If they had beer and tv's it would be the best place in Cave Creek   Yummy",)("We came here Sunday afternoon at 1:30_ The place was closed!! It clearly states on the door they are open 11to7 on Sundays_ Happened several other times too_ Seems like they open when they feel like it_ Terrible service_ Every time we go in there they always mess up our order_ I always have to check it on the way out_ The cashier asked me if I had a dime so he didn't have to give me coins back_ He said he doesn't like dealing with coins_ It smelled like sewage the last time we were in there_ We turned around and walked out_ It's a shame because we really like the food and it's close to home_",)('Friendly staff and always consistent chicken bowls_ A great part about this store is they give you bottles of spicy and regular teriyaki sauce to add to your bowls_ Some stores charge 25 cents for an extra little container of sauce_ This one also has a TV which I like to watch while inhaling the brown rice no veggie white chicken bowls_ :) Yum! Keep up the great work Sammy Sam_',)("This place is so yummy! The service is so friendly and clean_ I come here a lot during my lunch break_ This place is definitely one of my favorites because it's a healthier alternative compared to the other restaurants_ Will be returning!",)('The food here is great and healthy I love the food the workers are awesome and polite the teriyaki sauce is great I always ask for extra definitely recommend even after a work out its so healthy I recommend the spicy pepper steak or a large steak yaki',)
