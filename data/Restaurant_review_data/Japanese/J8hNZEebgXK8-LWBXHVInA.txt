("I love this place_ Their staff are not super talkative however that's ok_ I prefer friendly service over talkative any day_ Their food is always fresh and tastes wonderful_ Their kids portion is the perfect size for my lunch and it comes with cabbage and a drink to include the teriyaki chicken_ So tender and juicy_ You won't be disappointed_",)('Great food, friendly staff, reasonable prices! Love to get the extra meat on the chicken teriyaki so we can take leftovers home_  Their Bento box is reasonable and delicious also, but their teriyaki is the absolute best!  Always fresh and almost no wait as they are cooking it as you order it_',)("So happily surprised they have a Sarku here! I love this mall food place! It's fast and delicious_ I wish they spoke clearer English tho_ I found it rather rude that they just yell out your order to you in a demanding tone and then shuffling you thru the line like cattle to the slaughterhouse, rather than offering up more hospitality_ We are giving you our hard earned money here after all___",)("I love their food here_ If I'm ever out shopping and need to grab a bite, this is the only place I really go to_ Portion sizes are huge! Sharing is really the way to tackle a meal_ My friends and I split a chicken teriyaki with double meat and still don't finish it all_ \n\nChicken is always cooked fresh, the sauce has great flavor, and the staff are friendly_ Their is a slight language barrier but oh well_ They know how to make their meals delicious so I'm not complaining_ Never anything wrong with an order (and there have been about 100)_ \n\nGive it a try sometime! You'll love it_",)
