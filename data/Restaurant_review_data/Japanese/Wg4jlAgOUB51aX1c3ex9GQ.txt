("A true gem in Scottsdale and I probably shouldn't be yelping because I want to keep them a hidden secret_ \n\nMy friend and I went there for dinner, twice, in a 7 day period, so that says a lot_\n\nAs self proclaimed sushi aficionados, we went for the dinner, and stayed off the _5 HH menu to really get a sense of their handling of the fish_\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- negi hama roll (chunky)\n- uni nigiri\n- spicy scollops nigiri\n- okonomi chirashi \n\nThe fish is fresh and you can tell by the cut and taste_\nThe presentation is serene and traditional with attention to detail_\nThey've non of that Scottsdale trendiness or the culinary _fusion_ invasion_\nThe portion is generous and you'll going home satisfied and happy_\n\nThe service is good (Ken and his family are super nice and attentive, our cup of tea is never empty)_ The location is convenient and centralized_\n\nIn the sea of trendy sushi restaurants where the California roll, the deep fried stuff drenched in mayo aioli or sake bombs dominate the scene, Sushi Sen is a place for reliable, traditional Japanese food_",)('Very good quality sushi here_ Besides having Japanese chefs and servers, you know that you have found an authentic top notch sushi bar when half of the patrons are Japanese as well!',)("Just tried this for the first time, a few months after it opened in summer 2017_ An unpretentious family-run Japanese restaurant with cheerful and capable service, a friendly atmosphere, and great food_ Worth finding at the back of an almost-deserted retail complex on Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend_ We had a bento box and a pick-your-own-ingredients chirashi bowl, both very good (especially the sashimi components)_ The menu is extensive, though, including plenty of dishes for newcomers to Japanese food who aren't ready for raw fish_ In terms of quality and atmosphere, on par with Hiro's on 90th & Via Linda - so nice to have TWO go-to Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood_ Highly recommended_",)('Omg__ what a gem! Legit japanese restaurant! Agedashi tofu and sushi boat were amazing_',)('Been here about 5 times in the past month_ Authentic ramen- tried the miso and shoyu_ Also tried: tempura and soba noodles, agedashi tofu, chicken curry, tempura shrimp and crab roll_ They were all very good! I tried the yakisoba and the chicken karaage_ They were pretty bland_ I would not order those again_ But the ramen and the chicken curry are my favorites_  Best to make a reservation as they can get busy_',)("We went there for the first time and found a really pleasant restaurant with good service and great food_ The prices were also very reasonable for such good quality_ We'll be back many times with out of town guests when they want top notch sushi_",)('Service is horrible_ All they care is turnover instead of customer service, do not come here',)('Had another excellent meal at Sushi Sen! The fish is so fresh and served with fantastic attention to detail_ Took over as my favorite Scottsdale sushi restaurant, for the food, hands down!',)("Sunday , lunch___good crowd but Service was terrible!!!! You need to ask for service several times before you get to order & for water! I wondered if the rest of my order was coming?  I had to ask my other dish to-go_   We shared water after asking for 2 glasses_   We waited long  for the check after we kept asking 4 diff servers_  They said machine issues___really, can't  they add ?  Food was just ok so we won't return:(",)("We LOVE Sushi Sen! My husband and I frequent Sushi Sen about twice a month, though lately it's been more often - twice last week! The service is always prompt and friendly, the prices are reasonable (especially for Scottsdale), and their menu is quite extensive_ We love that Sushi Sen not only offers delicious, fresh sushi, but also many traditional Japanese dishes that are, lets face it, hard to find in the beautiful state of Arizona_ \n\nHappy Hour sushi is hard to beat (tuna tataki roll___ mmm), but our other favorites include hamachi kama (the largest portion my Bay Area-residing MIL said she's ever had), spicy miso ramen, takoyaki, chirashi, and my personal extra-favorite, assorted Japanese pickles_ \n\nFor me, there's no better ending to a long workday than meeting the hubs to share a cold Asahi and some of our favorite Japanese dishes_ Thank you, Sushi Sen, for providing an affordable Japanese dining experience, time and time again!",)("Some of the best sushi around, and I've found it again! Sushi Sen is the reincarnation of Sushi Ken from Ahwatukee (which was sold to new owners) and I'm so glad that I found out where they went_ Service seems to have improved pretty drastically from the old store, and the sushi comes out in quick fashion_ The real deal is in their _5 rolls as they have a ton of good quality fish like yellowtail and tuna stacked on top_ The happy hour menu (Monday through Saturday, 4:30pm-6:00pm) has a couple additional _5 rolls that are equally as good value_ The fish, as mentioned before, has a good bite to it and feels fresh - they don't overpower it with sriracha and allow the fresh taste of the fish to come through rather than other flavorings_ The restaurant space is a bit small and cramped though, so not great for large groups and might get a bit hectic during peak hours_",)('New go-to sushi joint - always order off the special board, never a disappointment!  Ramen is also awesome - lunch or dinner_',)("I'm so glad the sushi ken owners opened up this restaurant_ Phoenix can't afford to lose good Japanese food! I definitely like the new decor_ It's located in an upscale shopping area and you're greeted by a beautiful outdoor entryway_ We thought perhaps the prices would be raised, but it's still the same, affordable prices_ You are given a huge menu; here's what our go-to items are: Ginger tofu (or agedashi tofu), korroke (or crab cream croquette), zaru soba, sushi (hamachi, albacore, spicy scallop, saba, inari), the white tuna tataki roll, and the chunky spicy tuna roll_ Of course a Sapporo beer and sake as well_ And yes, this is all in one sitting_ I know___we eat like there's no tomorrow_ There are other menu items that are exciting like the tsukemen, all the -don's, and the intense chirashi bowls_ I definitely want to try the okonomi chirashi where you get to select 5 different items_ As the weather cools I'll be trying the nabeyaki udon to warm my soul_ There are still so many other menu items that I want to come back and try! Side note, my heart was also won over by the fact that they were playing the Ghibli soundtrack for my first visit_ I'll be a frequent customer for sure_ To sushi sen, _Ganbatte ne!_",)('Fresh Tuna & Halibut_ Staff is very attentive and courteous_ We had a sashimi plate & Spicy All Star_ Both delicious_ We highly recommend',)("I'm giving this five stars because the food was really great! The service was very good too_ It was very slow and they probably came to our table about 20 times getting water, Coke and even saw when my husband was blowing his nose in his napkin and they brought him more without us even asking_ Sometimes when it's slow in a restaurant the service gets worse_ Not so here_ There were 3 or 4 tables & the staff was on it!! Plus with the happy hour prices you cannot beat it! Will be back_ The only bad thing to report is a very strong odor that hits you at the door_ Smells like algae_ It's quite offputting but I got over it for their cheap yummy sushi and great service_",)('We did a staycation nearby at the Scott and took the complimentary ride to any place within a three mile radius_ We were greeted immediately and told the specials, so glad they had a few rolls at _5 each that should normally be much more because as soon as one of our on special Seafood Baked California roll came out we were both exceptionally pleased_ The service was the fantastic the fish was amazing! They nailed the Philly roll, we also had a pork noodle soup that was so incredibly tasty_ We will be back!! Mmmmm just the reminder of the taste from that roll and soup, makes me hungry!',)("If I could give zero stars I would_ I just made a reservation, hung up, and saw a missed call from the restaurant_ I called back and I was informed that I did not have a reservation_ It was literally two minutes after I called that I had this exchange_ The person on the phone explained that calls from the restaurant were made to confirm reservations yet my call back didn't mean anything_ I was told I didn't have a reservation and they couldn't accommodate my original request_ Not sure how they didn't have my information down yet I received a call back_ I was then told to come in and show my call log to prove my reservation_ Unbelievable!",)("The BEST new spot for sushi and japanese food in general!!! Very cool vibe and authentic japanese food___ MUST TRY even if you're not in the area!!",)('This place is no bueno_ The food is bad, the service is bad_ I have never had teriyaki or fried rice that tasted that bad_ The gyoza was OK but nothing special and really annoying for the price_ There hot pots are also horrible_',)("Any restaurant that would post a rude message about children crying in their restaurant should not be in business_ Posting a sign instructing parents how to discipline their children probably isn't a smart move_ _Take them outside if they make a loud noise_ really?",)("I gotta say this place impressed me_ Came in for some himachi sashimi and it was very, very, impressive!

I enjoyed the calm tranquil venue as well_ Thank you!",)("I have come to Sushi Sen several times since the business opened and the food is very good_ The staff always greets us with a smile and service is good_ Sometimes, as with all sushi restaurants, when many orders are placed you have to wait for your sushi_ This is a reminder to me to just slow down and enjoy the process_ Also their policy regarding noisy children is greatly appreciated_ It is a small space, very intimate, so a kid slamming his spoon on the table can really suck_ When we raised our son and if he got fussy we would just pick him up and go outside for a few minutes until he was calm so we didn't ruin the other guests experience_ It's called courtesy_ They make excellent sushi in Arizona not typical of many places in the Phoenix area_",)('This is absolutely my favorite Japanese restaurant in the Phoenix area_ They have a great menu with lots of authentic items_ They do everything very well and the sushi is outstanding_ It is now my go to place for sushi and Japanese food_ Sen is also very quaint family run eatery with fun atmosphere_',)("This place was great!
