I've eaten here several times - the sushi has been excellent every time_  I find it difficult loving places that are in strip centers with grocery stores next door - just doesn't really scream _fine dining_ - but, it is a comfortable laid back environment and I would easily recommend it for grabbing a casual sushi_japanese dinner_\n\nThe sushi and the tempura has all been excellent, no rushing to get you out, with good wait service (there's even a TV above the bar to keep track of the latest bball games!!)_",)("Haven't had sushi in forever and this place hit the spot! My semi sushi virgin boys enjoyed the deep fried rolls and their first warning for Wasabi from the staff___ who was wonderful all the way around_ Can't wait to come back and do this again!",)("Wow! First off, let me start by saying that this place probably has the best service! Amber and Kay were incredibly nice and so professional! The hostess (don't know her name) were very kind_ The staff here is just excellent and everything they do_ \n\nFood wise was the best! We got shrimp tempura_fried gyoza for appetizer, two sushi rolls (cali, vegas, and shrimp tempura), miso soup, and their spicy ramen noodles (forgot the actual name)_ Everything tasted excellent! Ramen was just perfect, sushi was good, and the shrimp tempura is so good when its fresh_ \n\nWe came on a late Friday night and there was no wait_ Restaurant is very nice and modern_ \n\nI will definitely be a regular here!",)('The food was good, Music and Environment Comfortable, the only down fall they were short staffed on this day but, our waitress Amber did a great job_ We will be back_\nThank You Amber\nprestige detailing_pdf',)("Decided to try out a new sushi place and saw this one_ They did not disappoint_ They have a unique way of handle orders_ All of their menus are laminated and you get a marker_ That means they don't have to keep printing them menus and probably saves them money in the long run that they can pass on to customers_ The menus were easy to read and understand_\n\nI have to say the stuff jalape os were amazing! Could have just gotten 3 orders of them and would have been content! They were able to make the curry rice vegetarian for us which was awesome! It was really good!\n\nThe interior looks great_ Very modern with red under lighting at the sushi bar_ It was bigger then I thought on the inside_ There can get a lot of people in here_\n\nStaff are really nice_ They will help you out with anything you need_\n\nOverall, this was a great experience and the food was awesome_ Totally recommend this place to everyone_",)('I worked for a Japanese company for over 20 years and traveled to Japan many times_  Over the years I have enjoyed sushi in a number of very expensive Ginza district (Tokyo) restaurants where my Japanese colleagues taught me what good sushi looks and tastes like_  Sushi Fix meals do not cost nearly as much as those Ginza district sushi restaurants, but the food is, in my opinion, just as good_  The sashimi always tastes fresh and is prepared properly _ _ _ thinly sliced and presented with ginger and wasabi_  The sushi contains fresh seafood and is presented as the classic delicate specially prepared vinegared rice rolls, not those giant too much rice rolls that are served at most  U_S_ sushi bars_  They also serve a very good selection of sake and great Japanese beer _ _ _ my favorite is Sapporo_  Overall, this restaurant is a hidden gem and a great place to find authentic Japanese food_  The service is very good, the food is not only really tasty but also a great value, and the remodeled interior reminds me of a number of Tokyo sushi restaurants_  You can certainly pay a lot more for good sushi in Scottsdale or Phoenix, but why?  This is not only the best sushi in Glendale, but in many ways the best sushi in the Valley of the Sun!',)("There was some deal for free dessert on valentine's day but we were still charged, even though we didn't eat it_ Sushi was decent and service was friendly",)("I came here on a late Friday night with my wife, we were in the mood for sushi and sashimi_ Thought to myself that if this place got such some great review on Yelp! why not give it a shot_\n\nFirst appearance, was it was a cute little restaurant_ It was kind of easy to find since it was hidden in the dark end corner of Frys_ The place wasn't too packed and wasn't dead either_ We were quickly seated and was informed that happy hour was going on_ SCORE! We didn't expected happy hour to occur on a Friday night, we thought it was like Kabuki in Glendale_\n\nThe price for the happy hour was amazingly cheap_ For the amount they charge for the item, the food was good_delicious_ Majority of the rolls were about _5, my favorite Vegas roll was on the happy hour menu so that was another plus_ We order the sashimi for 2 which I believe was about _27 dollars for 3pc of sashimi, there were 5 different sashimi on the cute little boat they brought out_ \n\nOverall we had a good time at this little shop! We will most definitely be coming back to this place regardless of happy hour or not_\n\nThe only downside to this, maybe it was the night shift or something, there was only 1 female waiter who was working at the time, maybe her co-worker were on break or something_ It was hard to catch her to put in an order or ask for more ginger or to get our bill_ \n\nHappy hour is: \nMon-Friday 2-5\nMon-Friday 8-close (10pm)",)('Quite plesant experience_ Big selection of rolls and good happy hour deals_ Nothing that blew my mind a tad more pricey than I would prefer_ Will return if on this side of town_',)("Great little place with an intimate setting_ This place was packed when we got there_ The service was great as well_ The sushi is just very average_ It's not a world changer_ The prices are not bad, but there are plenty of other places that have competitive prices with much better quality_ The sushi rolls were a bit skinny and they would fall apart easily_ I was expecting rolls that were a bit thicker, but these were skinny_ Overall, great place_ This can and probably is a favorite for many, but I'm not sure I'll go out of my way to go back_ Maybe if I happened to be in the neighborhood_ Don't take my word for it though, try it for yourself and find out_",)("This newly remodeled sushi joint is super cute, has happy hour all day everyday, is down the road from my house, has great service, and great sushi_ Needless to say, I'm a fan! They did a really nice job with the remodel_ Really clean looking and sleek_ We started off with the Jalape o Poppers: Fried Jalape o stuffed with spicy tuna drizzled with spicy mayo, and eel sauce_ We only ended up with 2 rolls that we almost couldn't finish_ The Booty Booty Roll: Tobico, Shrimp Tempura, Cream Cheese, Avocado, Eel, Spice Tuna_ Dressed with Spicy Mayo, Creamy Wasabi Sauce, and Eel Sauce_  It was very good! Very large bite but worth the chew_ And The Cardinal: Avocado, Cream Cheese, Salmon, and Spice Tuna, topped with Eel Sauce_ Very refreshing, a nice change from the deep fried roll_ I'm looking forward to coming back trying more happy hour items_",)('Went for late lunch with a friend around 2:30_ Excellent service ( only 5 people in the place ) they have a special discounted menus from 2-5_ This used to be Fresh Wasabi_',)("I can't say enough good things about this location_ I have gone here countless times and NEVER had a bad experience_ I always get great service with amazing food in a very timely manner_ Amazing lunch and happy hour specials_ Perfect for a quick bite to eat or a nice relaxing sit down dinner with the family_",)("What I look for in good sushi___ fresh fish, good cuts, specialty rolls that have pizazz, a greeting from the sushi chefs when I enter the place, and good service_  And I got it_\n\nI wasn't too surprised that I got all that tho___ I have been to their other location in Surprise, but I'm glad that they are a good backup to my normal sushi place_\n\nWhat did surprise me is that they have teppanyaki_  I haven't tried it, but with the quality of their sushi, I'm more than willing_\n\nDefinitely worth the try, especially for a hard core sushi person like me_",)("Came here for their lunch special_ Ordered the spicy California roll and the philly roll to eat there and one sweet thang ( fried rolls to go)_ I do think their lunch special is decently priced_ I did enjoy the spicy California roll_ It wasn't terrible compared to the philly roll_ I can't put my mind on it, I have had philly rolls before_ And in my opinion this one wasn't spectacular_ So out of the two- I would stick to spicy California roll_ Hope the the sweet thang roll is more satisfying for my taste buds_ \nIt is a definitely cozy set up in here_ It is welcoming and my server was really attentive which is always appreciated_",)("I LOVE Fresh Wasabi!  \nThis place is consistently good_  Always high quality and fresh_  They have a decent happy hour_  I don't think I've ever ordered something here that I didn't like_  I've tried as many of the rolls, sushi, and sashimi options as I can and I can't even choose a favorite_  I frequently go for the Snow White roll_  The place is small and casual, but clean and the service is usually just fine_  They've also been very accommodating with modifications and even custom-made rolls for one of my veggie-friends_  \nGo here for good sushi_",)("After reading all the great reviews I decided to take my significant other to lunch here_  Maaaaaaaan was it worth it!
