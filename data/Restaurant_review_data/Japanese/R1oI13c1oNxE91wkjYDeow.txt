Service is fantastic and the food is always exceptional and the patio is great for a nice evening dinner_',)("Went here for my birthday_  From the moment we walked in, I wasn't all that impressed_  Sure the decor and ambiance  is nice, but I think this is a place where people go _to be seen__  The tables are so close together that people kept bumping into my husband's chair as they walked by and when I was getting into my seat, my butt was pretty much on the table next to us_  The sushi was nothing to brag about and the rolls kept falling apart_  My husband had finished his beer well before we finished our meal and the server never asked him if he wanted another beverage_  Won't be back_",)('Sooooooooooo____a good friend of mine took me here for Happy Hour to celebrate my birthday_ Uhhh___after 15 years of friendship, how could she forget that I HATE Fish (Yes, all types of Fish!)\n\nI had to scroll to the appetizer list and there it was --  Sliders: Pulled Pork with our famous Korean BBQ sauce, served with Cole Slaw and spicy mixed Frites_ These were delish_ I had two of this appetizer and was completely happy_ I like that there are enough choices for me to consider on my next visit back_ Cheers***',)('My boyfriend and I had our first date here a few years ago and decided to go back recently to celebrate his birthday_ The sushi was very expensive, but it was good_ \nWe had some salmon sashimi, a spicy shrimp roll and a shiromi lovers roll that had asparagus, crab and halibut_ Its was all really good, especially the spicy shrimp_ After all this we were still hungry for more and ordered the fire dragon roll- spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, fresh tuna on top sprinkled with cilantro and diced jalapenos- Awesome! Loved it! \nIt was expensive but it was worth it!',)("I want to immediately say the sushi here is 4 start quality, maybe 4_5_  It's always fresh and if you know what you like, the presentations and flavors really are above average_  Honestly, when we have visitors in town, I recommend this place because the quality is great and I know that's what a sushi lover cares about most!  \n\nSo, why only a 3 start rating?  Plain and simple - quality of service_  The staff here is by far the least knowledgeable about sushi that I have every experienced_  It's clear they all want to be there because sushi is expensive and that's how tips get bigger_  Bartenders are completely uninformed about sake, which should always be an easy sell with sushi_  I had a server ask me to cash out in the middle of a meal once so she could go pick up her kid_  Just in case the managers care to read these reviews, a complaint like this should always come with some advice_  A better way to handle a server leaving in the middle of a meal is to transfer the check and let them collect all or part of the tip the next day_  Share some knowledge with the staff about the ingredients in the kitchen and why customers should love the product_  I could go on, but I'd rather focus on the food_\n\nThe chefs get it_  All of the plates look beautiful_  They have a high quality product and are proud to present it_  I wish there was a place on the bill to designate the entire tip to the back of the house_  Great sushi_  Always fresh_",)("This place doesn't disappoint_  Their food is always delicious - which continues to surprise coming from living by the ocean_ Hooowwww dooo theyyyy do it?! They have a private patio with TV's (if you are sports fans), and the bar inside is an awesome place to wait if you called in a to-go order -- which we do more than I'd like to admit_  Attentive staff, and an incredible HH that is a must-try_",)("We sat at the sushi bar and I wanted a roll with salmon but didn't want any rice and wasn't in the mood for a hand roll so the sushi chef, Eddie, recommended the Loch Ness salmon roll_ OMG! It was so delicious and fresh! They have this Scottish salmon that's so buttery and with the siracha and Asian pesto sauce, I have to say it was one of the best rolls I've had_ No rice means I can eat it all and have room for more yumminess_ Eddie took the time to make the roll to perfection and appreciated it_ Well worth the wait! Will be back!",)("Went early about 6pm_  Clean and neat place, nice deco_  Service was great, server quick and friendly_  Food though was very average_  Good but nothing special_  I would go here again but it isn't my first choice_",)('Love love love Pure! Hands down my fave sushi in the area, and their happy hour rocks!',)("A great place for lunch with a very modern  and chic interiorwhich is always pleasing - a great place for a business lunch too! I always have the bento boxes which have a little bit of everything in a good combo_ The tempura is exceptional too_\nNice to know that it's so close to home too!! YAY!",)("I have been to this place twice and waited to write a review until my second time_ \n\nTo be honest, the first time we went (was during HH), we thoroughly enjoyed their food and we had their Gyoza, edamame, spicy tuna roll, Fire Dragon roll and some other special roll they had_  Sushi was very good and so were the apps_  Our problem though was the service_  We were greeted and asked if we wanted water _or anything_, which was odd but we ordered a few cocktails and apps that were on HH_  The drinks took fairly long to get and actually our edamame came out before we got our drinks!  It was 5:30 when we ordered our other food so well within the HH window_  We got our food shortly thereafter and the waitress did not come by until we were almost finished with our last roll!  I ordered another drink on HH but she forgot it and then came back and asked if I still wanted it since it was not going to be on HH (she rung it in too late)_  I did not feel like fighting with her so I refused the drink, with no apology from her about the mix up_  We were disappointed with the service but we really liked the food so we thought we would wait a few weeks and come back_\n\nThe second time, both the food and the service was bad!  We ordered virtually the same thing but got a rainbow roll instead of one of the other rolls during HH_  Again, edamame came out before our drinks_  I do not know if the avocado on the rainbow roll was bad or what, but it was brown and unappetizing_  The yellowtail also had a brown tinge to it_  When we asked the server if it is normal, she said the yellowtail can look like that at times because all fish is different___ weird_  But she did say the avocado looked old but is probably still good____ weird again_  Needless to say, we tried pieces with salmon on top and low and behold, the seaweed was chewy -- almost as if it had gone bad_  We did not finish it_  Good old trustworthy spicy tuna roll may help matters____ nope_   Chewy seaweed again_  Fire Dragon roll = chewy seaweed_  The waitress said that is normal_  So, frustrated with the service here again and not in the mood to complain or waste any energy, we ate our Gyozas and edamame and requested the check_ Although we ate two bites of the Rainbow Roll and we said we didn't like it, we were still charged_  If it cost anything more than _4, I would have said something_  However, the service was just as bad so not sure anything would have been done about it_  \n\nWe definitely will not be going back here_  That same night, we went to Local Bistro right next door for dessert (we were going to have some at PURE and we were still hungry) and we had the best service_  Needles to say, that restaurant was packed at this time and PURE was only about a quarter full_  Does that tell you something? With the three other restaurants within walking distance of this restaurant, I would hope this place would have higher expectations for their service and food_",)("I've gone to many sushi places and we stopped here as its close to home_  The sushi was not top rated as many reviews have posted_  It didn't go over the top or offer anything unique_  Its super expensive sushi_  We can go else where in the valley and get better_",)("I dined at this amazing place on Sunday the last day of Restaurant Week - AZ_ They put together an amazing menu that was really worth the cost_ \nStarted with Miso Soup - perfect! Second had the Ahi Poke - which was prepared on these little triangles of what seemed like a soft corn tortilla_ I could not figure out exactly what it was - and doesn't matter - all I know was Yummo!\nNext course was Sea Bass - prepared to perfection_ Not too much flavor as to distract - but just enough_ \nLast was the roll dessert - with cream, berries and a sweet rice - I was in heaven_ \nAll that and an amazing bottle of wine that was half off - sitting outside under the misters at a nice 90 degrees - in Beautiful AZ - who could ask for more?",)('Nice place to enjoy happy hour and relax in a cool atmosphere_  The pear martini was well made and very good_  The bartender was friendly and made great drinks!',)('* Update - I gave it another chance_  Service is still a bit slow near the end of your meal but overall,  it was much, much better_  Keep making sure that Tuna stays fresh and I may keep coming back_ \n\n(Previous post, now updated ) - Like one poster said,  unfortunately this restaurant has suffered in the last couple of years_',)("I must say this place has gone down hill, it used to be amazing! Walking in the door my daughter and I stood there for quite some time_ The place was not busy due to the holiday weekend _The hostess looked at us  Never greeted us with a hello or a smile !! _  I was unclear if this girl even work here_ I finally took it upon myself to sit myself and my daughter at the sushi bar she then walked over with menus_ I have been in the hospitality industry all my life this is not someone I would have representing my restaurant_ Looking around it looked very j unorganized and unclean_ The fish did not look fresh which is presented in a case in front of you at the sushi bar_!!! I don't know call me crazy usually when you go to a sushi bar the chefs are very friendly and knowledgeable about different roles and specials they offer, this never occurred in this place_ I don't recommend it I've eaten out many different places I will not be going back or recommending to anyone!!!!!!!",)("Pure has some damn good sushi_ We had a lot of standard rolls that didn't have a particular _wow_ factor to them, but the fish was delicious_ \n\nThe place itself, however, is totally -not- my style_ Uberhip white everything with a wall made out of giant letters (the first thought that came into my head was _I really want to climb into that 'R_'_) and flatscreen TVs_ Oh, and poorly-designed restrooms (petty complaint, but still a pet peeve of mind)_ I'd like to come back___ maybe during the day it will be less___ uh___weird_ \n\nAnd___ charging for edamame and miso soup? Really? Come on_ Service was spotty, but our waiter did make an effort to apologize for any delays, so that was appreciated_",)('The sushi roll I got was very good_ The BBQ Pork Ribs were AMAZING! Loved the sauce_ The server was great too_',)("If your cheap don't eat here!  Expensive is good when it comes to putting raw fish in your mouth in the middle of the desert_  The sushi here is quality to the point that if I had no clue where I was in the US, and was served what I ate here last night, I'd have to say Hawaii or NYC_  That's a huge compliment considering how hard it must be to source fresh fish in AZ_  The tempura was great, the sashimi was awesome, and washing it all down with some sake and beer, made the blow of a big bill palatable_  Sushi is alive and well in the desert, and Pure is a great example of how to do it right_",)('Yelp gives Pure Sushi two __ but I think it is closer to three ____ The sushi was good, but I thought it was a little pricey, especially the alcoholic drinks_ Other than that, great service and a nice atmosphere_',)('This place has a good happy hour and the sushi_food is pretty good!',)('They do serve nice Lunch Bento Boxes SEVEN DAYS a week priced _11-18_\n\nI had the salmon teriyaki lunch bento box (_13) that included an oriental sauced side mix green salad,steamed rice,one large tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables (two big pieces of sweet potato, one zucchini,one onion ring) My salmon was tasty and a perfect size for lunch,not only did I get all that food I mentioned but my salmon was on top of pan seared mixed vegetables including baby bok choy_ \n\nService was especially good from our server and the manager_',)("Some of my friends have been bragging about this place and I was really excited when my Sushi group decided to have a meet up there_  I was not disappointed!
