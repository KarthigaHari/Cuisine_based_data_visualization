("I rarely write a negative review, but my experience at Pita di Vita tonight was enough for me to say, _Forget it_ There are a lot of Mediterranean style restaurants that do a better job__ My daughter and I had to repeat our orders to the cashier several times_ Then the order was wrong_ I'd asked for baklava packaged to go and never got it_ When I asked him whether that showed up on a receipt, he said no, that he didn't know I'd asked for it_ I don't know if his hearing was poor, but he really seemed to have difficulty getting the order right_ On my dish, the chicken wasn't very flavorful although my daughter enjoyed her dish_ I wouldn't go back to this place___more of a hassle than it's worth_",)('This place is outstanding!  Not expensive and not fancy, nut the food is truly incredible_  If you like mediterranean flavors, this is a must try!',)('My visit at Pita di Vita was excellent! I liked how there were pictures of all the food_ It was very clean and the guy that took our order was extremely friendly and a lot of help_ I ordered the Spicy Chicken pita wrap_ It was so good, lots of flavor, and HUGE! I will definitely be going back to this place!',)('I went in for lunch with a friend and we told the guy at the register that we were visiting the restaurant for the first time_ He immediately gave us a thoughtful recommendation and we ended up ordering what he had suggested_ I got the Philly Gyro, my friend got the Chicken Curry, and we split a side order of hummus_ The weather was nice so we decided to eat outdoors on their patio_ We started with the hummus and it was excellent--our server told us that it is made from scratch in-house_ The main entr e came out a few minutes later and it was delicious_ \n\nTo top things off, our server brought us out a small dessert on the house in order to thank us for stopping by_\n\nIn summary: excellent service, reasonable price, and excellent food_\n\nI would recommend this place highly to anyone!',)("The food here is amazing_  Fresh and prepared to order_  I had the grilled veggies and chicken with the home made hummus (so much better than store bought!)_ My friend had the chicken platter, both were excellent_  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was the price_  I will certainly eat here again, just not as frequently as I might like due to the cost_  But it is certainly worth it for really good Mediterranean food when the craving hits_",)('I love their chicken curry dish, but I think it is odd that it is served on a large plate with nothing else_  Is that so my whole family can eat it?  I would prefer a smaller portion and include some vegetable, pita, etc_  \nAlso, both times we ate there, the young lady at the register seemed not interested in helping us_  For example, I asked her what the grilled vegetables were_  Her answer was that they were vegetables that were grilled_  I asked again, what vegetables?  She pointed to the menu where it said _grilled vegetables__  After the third round of _what vegetables are in it?_, I suggested she ask the chef_   She did, reluctantly_  I think this girl needs a different job_  I ordered the grilled veggies and they are delicious, by the way_',)("Chicken shawarma was delicious_  Kids chicken plate my 11yr old and 8 yr olds loved_ It is a full plate_ My son had the cheese krisp___pita bread with melted cheese_  He's a plain eater so this worked_ I've been here in the past but had forgotten how good the food is_ Definitely not as fast as fast food but quicker than pita jungle for sure_ This is a great place when you need to get a quick dinner_",)("Absolutely fabulous_ Better than pita jungle's pitas for less_  Highly recommend_  Awesome",)("Everything I've had here has been on point and I always have enough leftovers for another meal_",)("Really good food! The Lavosh Aloha-Mex pizza was to die for! The Gryo Philly was great, but not as spectacular as the pizza_ Will be back, can't wait to try more!",)('Great food! Friendly service! My faves are the Shrimp del Sol and the La Vita Salad_ The shrimp dish was very spicy but ohhh so good_ La Vita Salad was delicious and I really enjoyed the mix in it: chicken, lettuce, olives, feta, artichoke___and the portions are enough to get you full_ This place is my fave for gyros too_',)("Update:  Hold the presses!  Tonight I returned to Pita di Vita and just discovered a salad that would launch a thousand ships_  Helen of Troy move over!   I ordered the Shrimp de Sol salad_  Was it cosmic convergence or dumb luck that found me the sort of salad that seduces you into eating it and then satisfies every part of your palate?  Even a manly man could sit down to this heaping bowl of garden greens, red onions, black beans, sweet corn, avocado, gourmet dressing, and grilled  jumbo-sized shrimp and satisfy the deep hunger that lingers within_  Add to that ensemble a soft, warm pita topped with artisan cheese and you have love_  Hey, I am not afraid to say that I was beside myself in consuming this magnificent culinary feat_  Beautiful salad_  Do I love thee?  Let me count the ways_    \n\nOriginal Review:\nAte at Pita di Vita last night_  Thumbs way up!!!  Most of the trainers at Funktional Fitness swear by this place so I had to go see what all the rage was about_  It's true_  The rich variety of pita offerings is impressive_  I had the falafel pita_  It rocked--and falafel pitas and I go way back_  The salads and paninis look very inviting_  The ingredients were fresh_  The service was professional and fast_  The guy who owns the place is really friendly_  Lots of good looking, healthy people stop by given that this place is next to a very popular workout scene_  I highly recommend that you stop by_  They have something for everyone at an affordable price_  Eat well_ Be well_",)('Wonderful meal! I had the chicken schawarma by recommendation of the woman taking our order_ My husband had the garlic shrimp_ Both were delicious_ This is a very casual, clean environment, paper plates, plastic forks etc_ but decent prices_ Nice people, good customer service_ No booze_',)('My first time here_ My husband visited a couple of weeks ago and loved it_  He thinks it is better than Pita Jungle, but I am neutral_ I had the chicken supreme_ The chicken was delicious but I was not a fan of the reddish sauce on the beans_  I am not sure what it was, but the flavor did not appeal to me and it was also used on the grilled veggies_ Hubby LOVES those_ We also had the chicken quesadilla which was pretty tasty_ The salad was really fresh and the lemon vinaigrette was very nice_ Small little place, and it was a little warm inside_ Only fountain iced tea which is a strike for me_ Food was not knock your socks off, but ok so it will not be a place I am dying to eat at all the time_',)("I had the spicy chicken wrap_ It was really spicy; well___on the bright side, I had lots of water to drink with it_ \n\nFirst of all, the place is a tiny place with no fancy decorations but it is okay if you want to just grab your food to-go_ Secondly, they make the food pretty fast_ My sisters and I got our order in about 5-7 minutes_ One of my sisters had the vegetarian wrap and the other one got a gyro (both really good, too)_ The only thing I would _complain_ is the price; my wrap is about _9_ Granted, it is big but I don't think it is worth the price_ I would come to this place maybe once in a while_ So, would I come back here again? Yes_ Would I be a regular? Nah_",)("Would've given a 3_5 if possible_ Good and quick food! Loved the original hummus- solid flavor_ Also ordered chicken curry and a falafel pita_ Good flavor in both dishes but did not leave us wanting more or tempted the same dishes again_ Lot of food though which is good for an empty belly and tight wallet!",)("The Marsala is awesome if you're vegan and gluten free! Ask for the tahini sauce as well_",)("First time here_ It was very convenient to stop here after the gym and pool time with the family_ We took it to go_ We ordered the chicken shawarma and the gyro_ Both with meals and side salads_ My daughter got the kids cheese crisp_ They packed it nicely to go and there wasn't a mess in the car_ Both adult meals was a good size_ Keep some gum handy or be prepared to brush your teeth after_ The sauce is heavy with onions__not in a bad way when u are eating but will need an after meal mint_ Good quick meal and it's not grease_",)('First time I went I loved their chicken curry _ It had a great spicy flavor and sweetened with raisins, apples and pineapple_ Second time visiting I felt the food was inconsistent_ The curry had few pieces of fruit and lacked flavor_ We also ordered the grilled veggies_ They were cooked perfectly but extremely over salted_ I will be back for lunch but will probably avoid dinner time_',)('We popped in for a quick bite and ordered the chicken cheesesteak and turkey pesto panini_ Chicken is seasoned well, but the panini and salad are AWFUL!!!! 1st and last time for us! Lettuce is wilted and tastes dirty_  Asked for no onions twice and they are piled on! Out of steak and most drinks in the fountain drink dispenser_ The dressing tastes like it is all vinegar_ Way too pricey (_30) for the quality of the food!!! Save your time and money____',)("I am currently living in Gilbert for a work assignment and have driven past this place numerous times_  My curiosity finally got the better of me, so my husband and I went there last night to try it_\n\nI was delighted!  They had a wonderful selection that satisfied both my vegetarian cravings and my husband's desire for meat_  The food was prepared quickly and the portions were huge_  I had the falafel with a side of rice and beans, and hubby had the chicken shwarma_  \n\nThe falafel balls were crisp and tasty, and surprisingly light_  Just the right amount of tahini sauce and vegetables_  And they put pickles on it!  Just like the Israeli places back home in NYC_  \n\nThe chicken shwarma contained a very, very generous amount of chicken, and my husband says it was seasoned wonderfully_  It had a little kick to it, too_\n\nOverall a great experience_  We'll definitely be back_",)("I love this place! I've never actually eaten inside because we always get take out_ The grilled vegetables are to die for!! I usually order the falafel wrap and hummus_ The green hummus has the perfect amount of heat_ Last night I had the tiramisu for the first time and I could have eaten at least 3 more little cups, so yummy!!",)("Wow_ So, if you live in Arizona, you've probably heard of Pita Jungle_ They have locations in Chandler, Tempe, and Scottsdale_ Now don't get me wrong, I like Pita Jungle a whole lot, and this is not a knock against them, but this mom and pop spot has them beat-HANDS DOWN :)\n\nFirst off, the portions you receive are larger_ This is quite the opposite of recent trends with restaurants increasing prices and reducing their portion sizes_ This place doesn't have that problem_ You will leave feeling very satisfied_ \n\nThe quality of the ingredients was great_ I could see the owner and cook in the back, so I knew my food was fresh_ I purchased a combo, and chose a Greek salad as the side (a nice option), and I was very pleased that I could get a whole wheat pita_ \n\nThey also serve salads and paninis_ Menu is diverse, without it being overcrowded_ \n\nDefinitely stop by if you are in the area_ It's worth the trip_ :)",)("Great food at a reasonable price_ I have been there a couple of times now and will return_ Nothing fancy but good service and tasty pitas_ I've had the chicken shawarma and the BBQ chicken_ Yum!",)("We finally gave this place a try after passing it up due to lack luster curb appeal_  It was terrific!  Wish we'd tried it sooner_  We had a traditional Gyro and a Philly Pita_  The meats and veggies were so fresh and tender_  Both sandwiches were generous and completely yummy_  The pita bread itself was the best I've ever had_  This is a clean & tidy little place that serves fresh, tasty meals made to order_ I liked that  you can see into the kitchen when ordering_  The restaurant is somewhat small but there is a good amount of seating, with a few extra tables on the patio_  Give it a go_",)('Great lunch_ My wife and I had the grilled chicken salad and fresh mozzarella salad_ Both were fantastic_ Fresh and affordable_',)('Best Chicken Shawarama in town hands down_  I like pita jungle and some of the other local places that are similar but for pure food taste and quality, this is the best in town_',)("if you've ever seen a highly rated place and wondered 'is it really that good?' That isn't going to be much of a question for long once you've eaten here_ \n\nYou walk into a pretty nondescript place_ It sits on a corner with a few outside tables_ Walk in and your order from a board (or plastic menu on the counter) and you probably think 'eh, what's the big deal?' BUT WAIT___\n\nYou order from the menu with a variety of delicious options, you hope delicious anyway_ Everything in the pictures look good, but wonder if it is_ DON'T_\n\nThis place will fool you_ You expect it to be clean, it's spotless, you expect the food to be good, but good is for the mediocre_ This is high quality, great tasting, beautifully prepared food that tastes almost gourmet_ \n\nI know, I was as shocked as you_ \n\nI ordered the shrimp del sol with the tails of the shrimp taken off (and they so kindly did it) and was blown away_ I wish I could go back and experience the first taste again_ It was deliriously good_ I mean, memorably_ \n\nIt was made of a bed of lettuce with a black bean and corn salsa with avocado and shrimp_ It was soooooooooooo good_ I would advise that you mix it all together_ The components are all incredible alone, and beyond delicious together_ So, mix it up_ On top is the chipotle cheese crisp_ You will know bliss when you taste the first bite of one of these_ I warned you_ Let the addiction begin (I'm wayyy ahead of you)_\n\nIt's the only thing I had, but truthfully, I don't need anything else to write this review_ I'm convince everything there has to be just as good_ It's made with such good ingredients and is so beautiful to look at, I know they didn't just do it for me_ It's a sign of absolutely loving the food you present_ \n\nNot only will I be back, but i'll be back again and again_",)("I was craving greek food and went here based on other reviews_ Folks are right, the falafel and other pitas have a generous portion of fresh, thick cut veggies (pickles, tomatoes, onion, romaine)_ The tzatziki was excellent, very flavorful (a lotta places mess that up with blandness, consistency being runny)_\nThe service was efficient and very courteous_ \nNext time I'll try the chicken schawarma_",)("My family and I ate at Pita Di Vita again tonight - and many nights in between my last review - and I think it just gets better! I love their garlic shrimp side - and at 5 shrimp for _5_95 the price can't be beat_  Still love their picante hummus and the chicken hummus is delicious!
