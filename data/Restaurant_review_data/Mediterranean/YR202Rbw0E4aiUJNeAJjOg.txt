("This place has been remolded since I visit 2 years ago_ I enjoyed it then, and enjoy it now_ It's clean and nice atmosphere to take friends_ The food was great_ I ordered the lamb with yellow rice_",)("My friend and I decided to try this new place tonight and was presently surprised with the food_ The atmosphere is simple but clean_  \n\nWe started with the hummus and I'd rate it about 4 out 5 on scale_ They give you plenty of pita so no need to ask for more like other spots_ For the main dish we both got the chicken shawarma plate_ Tasty chucks of chicken topped with an awesome garlic sauce all on a huge pile of rice_ We easily could have split the one plate_ \n\nAlso the staff was very friendly and courteous_ Definitely will be eating here again_",)
