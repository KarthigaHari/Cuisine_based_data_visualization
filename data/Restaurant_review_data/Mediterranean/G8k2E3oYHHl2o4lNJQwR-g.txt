We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate_ The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2)_ The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious_ Next time we'll pay the extra _5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two_ The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus_ Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern_Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet_",)("The best Greek cuisine I've ever had!
