to go at 13 min_ The hummus is delicious and chicken perfectly cooked_',)("I gotta hand it to Reimun Shleimun & Rian Hanna for making superb usage of Yelp_  As restaurants go, they make use of Yelp better than almost any restaurant in the valley_  From Yelp discounts, to a Yelp rewards program, to extensive video montages detailing their story & business operation, this is a business that knows to reach its customers in the social media age_  Pretty much the only perk they don't offer through Yelp (at least not yet) is Yelp cash back_  The end product matters the most of course, but reaching out to the community is key_  Their Yelp presence was part of what got me in the door, but the positive Yelp reviews was the bulk of it_  On a Thursday at lunch, I took in their Arrowhead location_\n \nYou'll find Pita Kitchen's Arrowhead location on the northeast corner of 67th Avenue & the 101 freeway (three doors down from Safeway)_  For those who have frequented the popular west valley Mediterranean spot Greek Wraps, the setup of Pita Kitchen's restaurant & menu will look somewhat familiar_  The menu tilts Greek but with some distinct Middle Eastern influences including a variety of kababs & basmati rice dishes_  There are large easy to read menus to glance as you come in the door & while you wait in line_  Like Greek Wraps you order up front & they bring it to your table_\n \nThis go around I was pressed for time so I got my food to go_  Upon looking over the menu I looked for items which Yelpers recommended & where I thought Pita Kitchen might stand out from the Greek Wraps & Pita Jungles of the world_  I started out with Pita Kitchen's signature Kitchen Egg Rolls (yup, egg rolls)_  These rolls are filled with diced gyro meat, spinach, feta cheese, & veggies and come with a taziki dipping sauce_  I also got an order of their Greek Fries per Yelper's recommendations_  These fries are topped with feta cheese & served with an olive oil mix that you can either dip or drown your fries in_  And lastly, this is _Pita_ Kitchen, so a pita was in order_  Not wanting an epic food coma in the afternoon, I grabbed a Falafel Pita_  Three big balls of falafel (deep fried garbanzo beans mixed with veggies & seasonings) served in a warm pita bread with onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, & Pita Kitchen's house sesame sauce_  Total cost for all the food including tax & with the 20% Yelp check in discount (remember this Yelpers!) came to _15_  In 5 minutes, I was served_\n \nLet's start with the egg rolls_  Three egg rolls in all_  The rolls themselves were juicy & delicious with the perfect amount of crunch on the rolls & some great seasonings on the meat_  I gotta admit though that I wasn't really in love with their taziki sauce (which is weird because I usually love taziki)_  Hard to pinpoint what was off about the sauce other than it was just flat_  Still, the egg rolls themselves are a fun innovative dish that looks different in appearance but stays resolutely Mediterranean in flavor_  Next up, the fries_  Fries were cooked perfectly & while the fries themselves didn't blow my socks off, the olive oil mixture was a delicious accompaniment & a unique alternative to ketchup to be sure_  Lastly, the falafel pita_  The texture of the pita bread was perfectly warm & pillowy soft just as I'd hoped_  The falafel & veggie mix inside was good, though I'll admit I still like Greek Wraps' falafel a little more_  Pita Kitchen's falafel has a softer more mellow texture whereas Greek Wraps falafel has a little more crunch and spice_\n \nOverall, I'd give Pita Kitchen about 3_5 out of 5, but I've rounded up largely to the discount I received (as well as a coupon for next time) & the super friendly counter service I received_  Pita Kitchen can definitely hold its own against valley based behemoth Pita Jungle, but on a personal level I still think for now Greek Wraps is king of the Mediterranean scene on the west side_  But keep at it, Reimun & Rian_  You've got a good thing going & a business model a lot of valley business owners could learn a lot from_",)("Delicious Gyros with tzatziki sauce_  Got one with extra meat, but definitely didn't need to because they had plenty of meat already on them_  Also had the hummus, both regular and cilantro, with steak, and it was awesome, too_  Welcome to the neighborhood_  I highly recommend Pita Kitchen_",)("Had high hopes for this place but was disappointed_ Walked in and watched pitas being hand made and baked fresh_ Kitchen was running at full speed, service was friendly,
