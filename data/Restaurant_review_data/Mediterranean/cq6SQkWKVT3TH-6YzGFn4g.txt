The thinner cuts come out crisper and allow the spices to take center stage on your tastebuds_ This is essential to making a quality gyro_ The subtle-sweet pita bread acts as the ideal delivery vehicle for the meat and veggies_ It not only literally wraps it all together, but does so flavor wise as well_ Fabulous_ \n\nGeorge's serves the basic styles of spaghetti and a few unique ones_ While I did enjoy their take on 'Greek pasta,' I am going to focus on the standard spaghetti and meat sauce_ Right know, I know you're thinking, _how do you mess up something as simple as spaghetti?_ I agree, it's a pretty easy dish to make, but it becomes much more complicated when you include meat sauce into the equation_ Here, George's has decided to make it as thick and meaty as possible_ I agree with this approach_ The finely ground hamburger is almost impossible to siphon from the sauce's already hearty consistency_ If you prefer your meat sauce to be more of a 'hamburger soup,' then this isn't for you, but I still recommend you give it a try_\n\nLastly, George's customer service is superb_ This isn't to suggest the staff is perfect in this area, but they succeed at creating a humble and warm atmosphere that is usually only found in small towns_ You feel like your are at a friend's house after a month of dining there once a week or so_ \n\nUltimately, George's has mastered the essence of what American-Greek food should taste like at a local eatery_ There are aspects of it that could improve_ This place likely isn't for you if a restaurant's decor has a large affect on your experience_ Pass it over and spend your hard earned dollar somewhere that will make you happy!

It was actually a filling meal_ Not a skimpy salad but a big ass salad_ I usually ask for dressing on the side, but the dressing- to-salad ratio was on point_ I don't like my salads bathed in dressing (aka fat--I actually like veggies! Shocker_ I'm weird_)_ I have never been a huge bread addict_ However, they serve the salad with a side of garlic bread that is like OMG--angels singing and the heavens parting at first bite_ Slightly gooey, yet crunchy edges____ And it wasn't soaked in a stick of butter a la Paula Dean_ To top it off, I saw they also have a Scottsdale location_ Damn, I love Scottsdale! Seriously cannot wait for my next Phoenix trip to get my George's fix_",)('As a native Chicagoan I can definitely say with no hesitation that this is the best gyros outside of Chicago_ Seriously_ And the people that work here are on top of everything_',)('Solid Gyro with a friendly owner_  Service was fast_  The atmosphere was pretty plain and not very inviting, but the food more than made up for it_',)("We ate here again today, 2nd time_ Better than the first, the ONLY real Chicago Greek Gyro in the Valley_ Worth the 25 minute drive_ George holds the bar HIGH, no other place we have tried in the past year even comes close_ I'm sure his other food is great, but we come for the Gyro's, why try anything else when you have a winner?",)("Beautiful people and amazing food_ For years my family and I come here and can always count on both Son and father to deliver an amazing smile and service_ The gyros are delicious, the salad and rice are light and fresh_ I know my boys love the French fries, light and crisp_ Thank you George's for having a great place in town to enjoy a great meal with great customer service!",)("First visit today and ordered the special (always do and don't ask what it is on the first visit), the gyro and the cheese burger_\n\nSo I believe the special was spinach ravioli with sundried tomato, mushroom, garlic, basil and a butter sauce_ First off, it was really quite good_ The sauce was spectacular, bravo, chef_ The ravioli was al dente, which is good, I think I would pull it just a bit soon though because a little texture would help but that's just me_ Seriously, I would order it again, it was good_\n\nThe gyro was as it should be and frigging stacked with meat_ Tiziki was on point_ Red onion added color and a bit of depth that made it just right_ Very good job_\n\nThe cheese burger was unique, served on baguette and formed to fit perfectly_ Somebody put some thought into this dish_ One of the better burgers I've had and there are no shortage of burger shops so that's saying something_ One of the top 10 in my opinion_\n\nThe fries are good_ Cooked correctly and seasoned well_ For me I would have used celery salt on them as opposed to table salt because when next to the gyro and the burger they came across a little plain, but again that's just me, I'm sure other would disagree_\n\nThe decor is fine, lighting is bright, the shop is clean as it can be, the folks are fun and clever with their approach to customer service, I enjoyed them a lot_\n\nSo one thing, and I almost hate to say it but kitchen staff should be dressed like kitchen staff_ That's important to me, so I was a bit disappointed that they weren't, once again though, that's just one guys opinion and I am equally certain that an informal approach appeals to a lot of people so I am not judging_ These guys have been doing this for awhile now and doing it very well so they know what they are about_\n\nI'll be back and I hope the ravioli will be on the menu when I get there_",)("This is a small fast-casual Greek Restaurant that isn't fancy but is clean with indoor and outdoor seating_ \n\nBased on just one visit I can tell you the portions are enormous and the pricing is very low_ Everything is under _10_00 and most plates run around _7_50_ They offer a very large menu with many choices_\n\nI made my order at the counter and paid and then picked a table to sit at_ The cashier_cook (maybe owner?) seemed very polite and was very efficient_\n\nI tried the Athenian Stir Fry with chicken_ I knew my platter came with salad and was just expecting the salad to be a little garnish on for my _9_00 platter but they ran me out a full size fresh Greek Salad with charred garlic bread_ \n\nIn only a few minutes latter I received  a styrofoam plate heaping with a mountain of food_ It was enough food to feed a small family_ Lots of rice and LOTS of seasoned moist chicken_ I thought the food was good but was missing the delicious fresh herbs that Greek Food is usually known for_ I figure the prices are so low that fresh herbs can't be used_ \n\nMy husband had the Porky Athens_ It also was an enormous plate with lots of rice and moist pork_ It was also good but also lacking those delicious fresh herbs_\n\nBecause of the location and the big varied menu I will try again_\n\nGreat value dining_ I felt like I got more than what I paid for_ For me this was A-OK and this is a positive review_",)("Yesterday was the first time we were ever at Grorge's famous Gyros & Pasta_ My husband went to pick up our food the first thing he noticed was the  restaurant was extremely clean _ The man at the counter said to my husband so this is your first time here you'll be back_ Well , he is absolutely right we will be back_ The food was amazing_",)("I wish the location wasn't so hidden! But the food is great! The Gyro is delicious, the slice it directly as its spinning and slow cooking_  The fries were good too!  I grabbed it to go, and it was ready within 5 min_  Great service!  Great food!",)
