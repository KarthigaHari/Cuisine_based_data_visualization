('Loved it! Food was delicious_ Had bread and cheese board, olives, and shrimp and grits_ Signature drinks were delicious_ Going back for a second visit tomorrow_ Definitely recommend_',)("Great food and great service_ I would definitely order the Shishito peppers, we ordered ours without the chorizo though since we don't eat meat_",)("We live in the neighborhood and have been to Tres several times_ The service has always been great_ The menu is very diverse with options different from most places in Tempe_ We love their calamari_ I just discovered their never ending Bellini for Sunday brunch_ Need I say more_  Rachel at the bar is quickly become our favorite_ She's friendly and attentive_",)('I am in Tempe on business and I stay at different Hilton properties almost every time I am here_   I think I found my spot at the Hilton Garden ASU Research Area for the simple fact it is connected to Tres_  What a great bar, menu and staff_  Great beers on tap and craft cocktails_  I really enjoyed my food, beverage and conversing with the staff_  Ashley and Charles are killer bartenders!!  Stop by and give it a shot_',)("Love the decor and feel of the place_ The interior design is tasteful and modern - I just wish it was a bit cooler so we could sit outside! Not much they can do when they're in Arizona (read: surface of the sun)_ \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly_ I loved that the style was a combo of tapas, entrees, and big plates_ The pork flatbread blew my mind_ Everything else was great too, but that dish was a step above the rest_ Will definitely be back when I am in AZ again_",)("Bacon wrapped dates are to die for_ Everything I have tried here so far has been great! This place is a little pricier for food, but I honestly don't mind spending a little more because the food is excellent_ Ashley the day bartender is very friendly :) \nRooting for this place!!!",)('Tres chic decor but very noisy___too loud to have a quiet conversation across the table_ We went for a Sunday afternoon brew but were disappointed in their rather limited tap selection_',)("We were in the neighborhood and this popped up on Yelp so we thought we would try it_ When we pulled up we were a little suspect because there was no one around and it was attached to a midpoint hotel_ I'm glad we went in and tried it because the food was delicious_ I really like the ambience of the restaurant as well_ The dishes were interesting with strong flavor_ Kind and attentive service_",)("The newly opened Tres Tempe bills itself as a Mediterranean_Southwest fusion spot_  It is attached to the Hilton located between Guadalupe and Elliot on price_  The dark metal, black stone, and warm wood interior create a warm contemporary feel_  There's a semi open kitchen and a spacious bar in the main restaurant_  There's also a nice patio_beer garden with an additional bar, several tables, TVs, and games like bags_   All the staff is friendly and happy to answer questions and the service was good_\nFor the month of March (2018), happy hour is all day with deals on several small plates and _4 drafts_ Small plates run  _6-14, medium _12-_30, large (shared by 2-4 people) _59-69_  The draft list is small, but local with good options_  We didn't venture into the cocktail or wine list on this visit_   We ordered the papa bravas, chickpea fritto misto, and crunchy shrimp lettuce wraps_  \nThe problem with fusion, in my opinion anyhow, is that sometimes the traditional takes are kind of perfect and the _new_ spin falls flat_  Okay, so I'm really just not a fan of fusion, but I love tapas so I had high hopes_\nThe papa bravas were a perfect example of not messing with perfection_ The dish was made with halved fingerling potatoes_ They weren't roasted in enough fat and were very dry and bland--a little salt would have gone a long way here_  The menu description didn't seem to apply to what we were served--I'm assuming the harissa sauce was red and the green sauce was some kind of ailoi_  Regardless the balance was off on the dish_  The red sauce was sweet, spicy, and the best thing on the plate_  This was not an improvement on the tapas staple_ \nThe shrimp cups were refreshing, but again the balance seemed off_  I though the shrimp and jicama slaw were tasty, though the shrimp seemed a bit limp and my dining companion complained they were too  _shrimpy__  I felt like it should have been pico or pickled jalapenos--both was a little too acidic_\nThe chickpea fritto misto (veggies battered in chickpea flour) were tasty_  As someone who is not a huge fan of kale, battered and fried it was pretty good_  We both agreed the _red chili jelly_ (it tasted like spicy sweet and sour) smeared on the plate was much better than the lime crema dipping sauce, which was pretty bland_ There was no queso fresco on the plate_  I doubt it would have added much to the flavor, but without it, this was a brown plate that was visually unappealing_  It was still the best thing we ordered_\nOn a whole, we felt like the food was solid, but not exceptional_  Given the prices, we expected more_  Our verdict was that Tres Tempe is a solid happy hour stop, but not a regular dinner spot_",)("I really want to love this place_ But I don't_\nWe have been here 5 or 6 times and it is hit and miss_ I think definitely more misses than hits_\nThe service is unpredictable_ The servers don't have good knowledge of the menu and getting a drink from the bar is always slow_ Last time_ I was served my dinner before even getting my glass of wine_ Also, food often doesn't come as ordered, like as substituted side or no sauce or no onions on the burger_ Last night we ordered the bacon wrapped dates, they came out about 2 minutes after we ordered them and they were ice cold_ They remade them for us_ Then I got the ribeye_ It was mediocre at best, not seasoned well and a very, very fatty cut_\nTempe really needs places like this, I really wanted to love it, but I am not sure_if it's even worth trying again_",)('We enjoyed a fabulous lunch eating experience_ It is very quiet for lunch as this is a new restaurant and hidden away with the adjacent Hilton hotels_\n\nWe drooled all over the delicious Pork Wings_ But the Bacon Wrapped Dates were even better_ Wow! We highly recommend choosing the dishes and sharing rather than the entrees per person_ There is so much to share and enjoy that we will be back again_ Foodies will definitely enjoy this gem___\n\nOh___and do save room for dessert_ Wow!\n\nMany dishes are small portion, beautifully garnished with fantastic flavor! Be sure to ask about the quantity for your specific request_ Enjoy!',)
