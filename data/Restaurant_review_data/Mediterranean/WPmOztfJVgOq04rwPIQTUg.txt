('This place is amazing!! I had the chicken shawarma plate that featured the most well seasoned, tender chicken shawarma I have ever had_ The rice was incredibly flavored with a delicious side salad that had a wonderful dressing as well_ The hummus is so fresh and tasty_ The pita is spot on_ My boyfriend ordered the falafel plate which he said was the best falafel he has ever had_ We go to a lot of Mediterranean restaurants and this is one of the best_ Very clean inside as well! I highly recommend this place_',)('best Mediterranean food in Phoenix no mixes all fresh_ homemade baklava with Turkish coffee delicious falafel best I have had in Phoenix',)("Stumbled into this place on while feeling a craving for Mediterranean food_ Fantastic food, and pricing was good (although they were doing 50% off for their opening days which ends today) but even then, for the amount of food I got and how flavorful everything was I'm glad I stopped in_ Great change of pace from the restaurant that was in that building before_",)('Everything on the menu is delicious! I have eaten it all_ The food taste home made as if from their home kitchen to my plate_ Their food is the best tasting Mediterranean food around_ I hope they become busy to offer the buffet again_ Fabulous food! anyone who says it is not does not know what good food is_ Only restaurant that my belly can digest the food with out getting ill_ A thousand stars for that!!!!',)
