Pizza and cannolis are amazing! It's a family restaurant and Pauly, the owner is very personable!",)("What a fantastic surprise! A total hidden gem_ The food & service were great_ Ordered a cheese pizza and the baked ziti_ Baked ziti was one of the best and something I will order again_ One of the best pizzas I  have found here in Arizona & I would highly recommend Yo Pauly's!! Can't wait to go back_",)("I agree with Marcus_ I'm an east coast transplant also_ The pizza here is pretty good for AZ_ The baked ziti was mushy and bland and the top crust mozzarella had meatball in it_ Weird_ Just stick to the basics, because it works, ya know? \n\nWe also got a salad with chicken_ The lettuce was green and fresh and not many bad or rotten pieces, which is rare in restaurants_ The produce was very good_ But the chicken was cold, definitely not grilled fresh and put on the salad_ And it also tasted like it might have been pre packaged with preservatives_ Not good_ \n\nThe sauce is sort of sweet but also acidic and the food is really rich_ I think the sauce is what really makes Italian food good, and the sauce here just isn't great_ I've had worse, but I've definitely had better_ I had high hopes because I heard these guys are from NY_ But It's just ok_ Not great but not terrible either_",)("I've only been once but wow_ I was impressed_ This place came highly recommend by my husband's New York born and bred boss_  This is the only place he will get pizza_ I can see why_  \n\nMy husband tried the pizza (cheese pizza's are on special this summer, just sayin')_  He got his loaded with pepperoni, sausage, pineapple and ricotta_ He downed a personal sized pizza in record time_ I've never seen him so happy_\n\nI decided to try the chicken parmesan meal_ It was terrific_ The chicken was crispy, juicy and flavorful_ Not greasy as some tend to be_  The red sauce, which I hope is what they use on the pizza because it was perfect, was just the way I like it_ Not a hint of sugar_ There is nothing worse than sweet tomato sauce in my book_\n\nI would happily go again and I would recommend highly_",)("Some of the best pizza I've ever tasted in Arizona_ Plus great friendly service and a nice atmosphere_",)("Back home pizza_   Like being back in Brooklyn_  Get a slice and you are on Roebling St 1968!  That's in Williamsburg near Marcy ave and Broadway under the El_   Family place small and friendly_",)("If you are looking for exactly the same taste and quality of Real New York Pizza, look no further! I've been in the valley for forty years listening to all the excuses, the dough,the water can't get this or that to make it the right way___ all BS, this man does it! I've sent all of my NY Italian friends and non- Italians to this tiny pizza shop,and have heard nothing but the best praises and thank you from every single person _ I personally drive twenty-five miles ,round trip to buy what Pauley's offers, everything is excellent, always! When you order your pie tell them that Steve the Pinstriper sent you, then enjoy the knots and the delicious marinara sauce while your incredible pie is being prepared for you_ I have a hard time wiping the smile from my face every time I'm there_ The people ,especially my friend Pauley all add to this experience_ Sure Bianca's and Grimaldies are excellent pizza ,but they don't remind me of what was available in Times Square which set the bar_ Trust me you'll love this experience!",)("This place is gem_ I'm so happy we found this place! Exactly the type of pizza we were craving_  Their food is BOMB! Antipasto salad is loaded, marinara sauce is so flavorful and the pizza___ THE PIZZA!!! BOMB!!\nWe ordered 18 in but can't wait to try the ultimate 24 in pizza_ It'll be humongous piece of heaven_ \nWill be returning to this place for sure_ \nSo so yummy_",)('We came back because the first visit was so good_  This time I tried the gyro -- OMG!!! The best I have ever had_ They make their own tzitziki,  and grill the meat for a perfect taste_ __WOW!! Hubby had the lasagna,  which we figured would be wonderful based on the white pizza we had on first visit_ But, we were not prepared for the DYNAMITE flavor of that marinara sauce with the light noodles, meat combo_ The marinara is so fresh, light on flavor without any heavy herbs drowning out that wonderful fresh tomatoes taste_ Love this place!!!',)("Being from Chicago and visiting Scottsdale,  AZ and grand canyon_Sedona_ We loved the NY style piazza_ Go figure_ I ordered four extra large 24_  pies_ Sausage and onion_jalapeno_  After feeding 20 people I still had a whole pie left which we finished after a late night game of charade_ Friendly establishment and really excellent quality pizza_ Kids were given a choice of anothee local establishment_ And they chose hand over fist Yo Pauly's_  Would definitely hit them up again when we are in town_",)("Yo! This place is the real deal_ I'm a New Yorker -- born and raised -- I should know_ The owner and the crew are just superb_ I haven't seen anything like this place since I moved here from New York 20 years ago_ I wish I'd known about it sooner_ Fountain Hills___shame on you!",)('Awesome food!  I thought I was in a pizza parlor on Long Island! Calzone was fresh dough , was perfect!  My slice was just how I remembered it back home!!!!  The service was great!, David made us fe like we were coming there for years!!',)("Ordered a pizza from here the other night, seems like I have found a good place to compete against Grimaldi's___\n\nPizza came quickly and was delicious___ A little on the expensive side___ The thing I like about it is that it seems very home-made and not part  of a repeatable equation like Grimaldi's___ \n\nI will be ordering here again, no doubt about it_",)("My favorite pizza, super calzones_ But the BEST are Pauly's Astoria Wings, yum-a-rooski with oregano and a hint of lemon_ Delicious!",)("I used to go to Yo Pauly's on a consistent basis whenever I had a craving for their salad, sandwiches, or appetizers_ However, they took some of my favorites off of the menu such as the pepperoni rolls, and the service and quality of the food has become inconsistent_ There are more reliable places in town serving the same style of food_",)("Best pizza in Scottsdale_ Crust is fluffy and crispy_ If you're looking for authentic NY pizza, this is the place to get it_",)("I would say 5 stars if we're purely just talking about the pizza, but I have to drop it to 3 when you consider customer service as well_ After having ordered delivery from Yo Pauly's multiple times, I have concluded that the owner, Pauly, appears to be aggressive and simply rude at times_ If you're okay with possibly running into a not-so-friendly environment or lackluster customer service, but AMAZING pizza, this is the place for you_ It's a shame Pauly isn't nicer or more helpful because that would easily bump this 3 stars up to a 5_ \n\nP_S_ For all those ricotta lovers who don't like giving up the marinara with the typical white pizza, order the _Not So Whitestone Bridge_ pizza_ It's on their secret menu and TO DIE FOR!",)('Awesome east coast, NY pizza joint_ The staff is so funny and pays attention to every detail_ We have been looking for a genuine place to east some yummy pie_ The crust is light and airy, yet crispy_ This place is a must!',)('Definitely the best NY style pizza both my wife and I have tasted in the Valley and would highly recommend_ Meatball parm sandwich is outstanding also_ The place is small with limited seating with no bar but does serve beer and wine_ They DO prepare a 24_ true NY pie too, feeds several people_ Enjoy!',)("Yo Pauly's is the closest I've found in the Valley to _northeastern_ style pizza (i_e_ NYC_Boston-non-PizzeriaRegina style) that I've found_\n\nI have to admit that I'm not crazy about their entrees, and I've tried several of them, so I'd stick to the pizza_\n\nThe owner is (mercifully) not a Yankees fan - he's a Mets fan, so that's good, and he's very friendly in that Noo Yawk way_\n\nAs others have said here, it's really not a place to sit down and a quiet meal, it's definitely geared for takeout_\n\nGlad to have a decent pizza place just down the street from me!",)("We had a little bit of a delivery issue the other night and the owner not only called us to apologize over the phone, but when we got there, he came out and apologized and more than fixed the issue_ GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! And the pizza is always the best! We highly recommend Yo Pauly's, you will not be disappointed!",)
