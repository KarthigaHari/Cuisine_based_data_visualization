I love how they have no rice sushi options
Ambiance is relaxed and friendly, service is efficient, price range is reasonable, sushi is delicious

They also have a stamp card if you fall in love with their ramen and decide to eat there more than once
We have been to Japan and the ramen is similar in taste

My favorites are the Arizona, Hurricane, Tiger, Kee, Salmon Avacodo, and the California rolls are the best!
 Large selection of specialty sushi rolls, fav is the Lotus on Fire roll

Hip decor, reasonable prices and most importantly FRESH ingredients!
In desert: green tea soft ice-cream, mocha cake, and of course fresh fruits

I would definitely come back! Next time for their rice bowls!
The chicken and the pork were both delicious the best healthy chicken and rice combo I've experienced

The rice tastes wrong, the fish is cut wrong
We ordered a variety of items on the menu including smoked monkfish liver, beef tongue and many different skewers

The spicy tuna was great but it was an even toss up of good and not so good rolls
Just had a simple lunch_  Spicy tuna roll, salmon and yellow tail

Their salmon sushi pizza is the best I have had, anywhere
The Viva Las Vegas roll looked and tasted great. My husband really liked the tuna_  Salmon was OK, I've had better

If you're only going for a good dose of sashimi though I'll highly recommend it !!
Also had their 6 piece sashimi platter that was super fresh and amazingly good which had 2 pieces of fresh Uni

For the lobster, what's not serverd is used to make the best miso soup that I've ever had
We really enjoyed the steaming hot miso soup perfectly balanced not too salty or bland
