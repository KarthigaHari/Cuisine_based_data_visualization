just a restaurant has a great bar and a outside deck with one of the best views of Las Vegas_

Sit at the bar and get to know your neighbors!

my order is always the same: Veggie burger, with cheese, side of soup and fruit
We usually get the bacon cheeseburger

I order a different cheesecake each time because they are all delicious
Mac and cheese was creamy and good not over cooked

The fries were hot and had a nice salt & pepper seasoning
One star loss for the fries which were a little oily and limp

club sandwich and cobb salad always with a side of of greek fries
Some of my favorite dishes include the french dip, the bbq chicken salad, and the balsamic glazed chicken

For a bar, they have great food! Drinks are cheap and good happy hour deals
The drinks prices are decent but best during happy hour

I was not happy with the bad service and then asked what beer might match my favorite beer
The draft beer and wine lists were solid and the cocktails were pretty good

We had dinner in the patio, which was lovely
By the end of dinner, everyone's plate was empty

menu was oddly limited and had nothing in the way of sandwiches or other medium-sized meals
the dining experience was about me and my wife having  wonderful meal together

Great food and good breakfast atmosphere
All in all, the Breakfast Platter didn't hit the spot at all
