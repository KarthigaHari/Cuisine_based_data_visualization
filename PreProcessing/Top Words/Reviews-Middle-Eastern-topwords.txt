The shawarma wasn't that big compared to other places but I liked that it was warmed on a panini press first
There were pieces of chicken skin fat in my shawarma platter and the salad was stale, the fattoush salad we order didn't have the crispy chunks of fried pita it comes with

Solid hummus, good tabouli and Greek salads, and an incredible lentil soup
 I ordered an order of hummus, falafel, and a chicken schwarma

Pita bread is so outrageously good 
The plain pita is tender and fresh

Salads look and taste very fresh
There are too many excellent fresh Mediterranean places in the metro area to have such terrible pita and inconsistencies

And the rice it came on was awesome
They came with rice, bread and a fresh salad as sides

I had the Hummus and my friends both had some really good salad type thing
came with a delicious light side salad with a savory dressing, olives and cheese

But then a month later my falafel sandwich was a dismal disappointment
The buffet was a good selection of typical Mediterranean and Middle Eastern fare: pita, hummus, falafel, long grain rice, baba and tabuleh

Each order come in a plate with fresh salad and tahini sauce
My only suggestion is to ask for extra taziki sauce but that's more of a preference

The lamb meat was awful smelly nasty and the chicken meat was hard and the rice cold, the resturant was cold too
The food well prepared and obviously better for you then some mystery meat sandwich and fries and yet the place isn't that crowded

I ended up ordering a lamb dish and my partner ordered a chicken dish
The lamb I had was probably the best I've ever had
