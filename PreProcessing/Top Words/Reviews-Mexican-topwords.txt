We usually go for chicken tacos and quesadillas
I had the fried avocado tacos and the black eyed pea salad

The chips_salsa_guacamole side is a must order
I wish they would give out a larger bowl for the salsa since the small cups 

The one of the things I did like was the tortilla chips with the hint of lime and the fresh pico
Burritooooooo lunch special!!!!! awesome, tons of chips and salsa

I got a strawberry margarita, guacamole, and beef burrito. The drink was strong, guac was fresh
Our steak burrito was soupy and couldn't finish it because it tasted so bad

"Tortillas and chips made fresh!  Love it!"
Love the fresh squeezed juice from bar for cocktails

They came to the table piping hot, and the mix of brisket and cheese was perfect along with the extra crispy tortilla
The cheese on the refried beans had cooled over as well

The tortilla wasn't grilled long enough so taking the first bite was kinda soggy it's loaded with rice,beans and other toppings
I had the two taco plate of grilled chicken and steak tacos with re-fried beans and rice

The meat was very good and tender, the green chili sause was good but on the bland side
The tartar sause it comes with is so awesome

I will continue to go to Macayo's with friends and sit in the bar for happy hour
Great tortillas, good fresh salsa bar and some of the best taco meat

We had the carne asada for two and there was plenty of food
I really like their carne asada wet burrito so GOOD!
