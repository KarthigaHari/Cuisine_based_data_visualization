The Leo has to be one of the best salads in Charlotte
Fried chicken: sour pickle brine, warm mushrooms and potato salad, soft egg

Hummus, pita & that lentil soup are better here than anywhere else in the valley
The falafel and hummus comes in a pita pocket filled with tahini, tomatoes, pickles, cabbage, cucumbers, and lettuce

Greek food is as good as any other Greek restaurant that I've ever been too
The food was ok, not great the Greek salad was not impressive it didn't even have onions the chicken was tasty

Amazing fresh ingredients, everything is made from scratch, and wonderful fast and friendly service
I'm not so sure that the strawberries were wild as advertised, but they were fresh!

My husband and I love Mediterranean food and we love hummus and butternut squash ravioli
All of the grilled meat is good as is the baba ganoush and hummus

I had the gyro sandwich with fries
We have gotten the gyro sandwich and the chicken alfredo and my kids are hooked

The pita was one of the best ones I've had, they were loaded with meat
One of our gyros had some relatively dry meat in it

I went with my boyfriend he got the lamb kabob and i got the chicken plate
The bite i had of lamb was also very good my boyfriend wished it was a little more on the medium side but everyone has there own preference

The falafel sandwich and fries are fantastic, and I think only about 9 bucks
There are plenty of other good falafel_shwarma places around that won't give you a hard time over a bottle of water


My favourite beef shawarma wrap I've ever had!
Beef and lamb shawarma plate so good must try
