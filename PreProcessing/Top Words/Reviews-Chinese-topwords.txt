Family fave is the chicken fried rice, mouth's watering just thinking about it
I had the Soy Fritters with Curry Rice, and I don't know if it was just the wrong dish to order or what, but I didn't think it was very good

They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start
We also tried their fried pork chops served with a freshly made sauce,  excellent

As for the food, I was very impressed by the soup_ We had hot and sour soup, and ordered a second one
Mouth feels terrible after eating the Sliced Lamb Potato Noodle Soup

I ordered beef and broccoli my girlfriend got orange chicken both were fresh the broccoli was not soggy or over cooked
The Chef's Beef noodles were delicious with lots of great flavor

Great place for dumplings and brisket noodles, we tried their wonton, dumplings, beef brisket, fish balls, and crispy fish skins
The noodles in the Mongolian Chicken dish were extremely soggy and pretty much turned into a doughy mess in the sauce


To start off on a good note, the food quality and portions were decent_ I had a noodle, congee, duck and fried pork - everything tasted amazing and on point
We tried the Taiwanese beef noodle, Taiwanese minced pork and rice, hot pot tofu with salty fish and chicken

My other all time favorite dishes is the snow pea pods, clams with black bean sauce, beef with wide rice noodles and the ground basil chicken
Their dishes other than duck are a better choice as it's heavy on flavour and sauce typical of northern Chinese cuisine

MUST try their Shrimp Vindaloo, Butter chicken, and Korma
The shrimp korma was a creamy, spicy sauce with cashews and perfectly cooked shrimp

The tawa chicken was a little spicy but perfect in every way with a beautiful curry with white chicken and potatoes
Definitely spicy as others have mentioned, I go medium and it's what others may consider hot hot!

I was also surprised to see a selection of asian food like egg rolls and fried rice
I am not fan of tomato the egg curry is like mix of tomato gravy but naan is super delicious and soft_within two days I been here twice
