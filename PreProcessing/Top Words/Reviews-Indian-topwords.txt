saag paneer, daal, Raita, hot naan and rice along with chopped onions and pickle
Naan is best fresh and hot


The buffet has over 12 different dishes to pick and choose from
The decor and ambience is appealing for an Indian buffet restaurant

Have not had Indian often but the lunch special
I went to have buffet for lunch on Dec 28

had a steak with a spicy sauce on rice that came with appetizer and dessert
I wish they include rice with the entree

I decided to get the tikka masala and the palak paneer and some rice
I ordered lamb masala, chicken tikka masala and paneer for an appetizer

spicy butter chicken and great fish pakora
Butter chicken and Nan goes great together as do the desserts

The mushroom tikka masala was particularly interesting if you want a veggie option
we had the Mango Chicken and the Tikka Masala Chicken curries

The beef curry was great, the lamb was perfect
The plum chicken, vindaloo, and lamb special are all very good meat dishes

the alu ghobi and matar paneer are delicious veggie dishes
My wife ordered the paneer tikka masalla and loved it

I can get dinner for two people with a satisfying lunch the next day
I've tried both the full sit down dinner and take out a few times each
