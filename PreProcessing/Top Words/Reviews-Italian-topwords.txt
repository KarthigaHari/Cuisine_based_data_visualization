As for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint
And the pizza, they do it right_ Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi

Grab a classic white-clothed, candle-lit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering gluten-free or whole wheat pasta
The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like_ The Alfredo pasta was flavourless

The cream sauce tasted like flour paste and flooded the pasta, The red sauce was not acceptable for an italian restaurant
Made daily with sauce from scratch, I highly recommend the Fettuccine Alfredo

The pizza is delish, the salads are sooooo good, they ALWAYS have a Polygamy Porter on nitro for my hubby and a fabulous glass of Malbec for me
My wife and I were regulars for wings on Wednesday and they have changed recipe for the sauces on the wings, as well as the mista salad

They also have pretty good cheese steaks
Started with the Drunk Bread and it was tasty. A unique combination of crusty bread and cheese

Worth 5 stars for the garlic bread alone, but there's oh so much more
Amazing crusty bread with a huge portion, they don't skimp

Italian Risotto that daily chef menu that was Chicken by White wine sauce
It's BYOB but the recently opened a bar and they have a great wine selection

The sauce is sweet like a real Italian pizza, the crust is crispy and tastes extremely fresh
The food here is basic italian_ But done really well_ The salad is cold, crisp and fresh

The Italian food her is truly amazing
The pizza was simply AMAZING. The crackling crispy crust was the best I've had in Tempe

The wait staff was very friendly and service was perfect
The space was clean and tasteful with a really interactive and friendly staff
