Delicious, friendly staff, cool atmosphere, all around great experience!
Definitely try their eggplant and ANYTHING with pesto, it's delicious and the proportions are perfect for lunch!

Service is disappointing, however the wine store is lovely and has a nice selection at reasonable prices
We had a great time among friends and the staff, and the food with wine is amazing!

We've been regulars at the Apricot Tree for ages, for both dinner and dessert
Although I was full I couldn't pass up tasting each dish, and my companion lucked out since they scored half my dinner

After reading others reviews about the steak frites and location we decided to give it a try
The steak tartare was awesome

I had the Quebec raised lamb w lentils and veg_ My kids had the flank steak w blue cheese sauce and my husband had the scallops
The bagel with chive cream cheese with smoked samon and capers was all tasty, but not a stand out item

We selected breads , warm and flavorful,  from a tray brought to our table often
In my shame I must confess that the best I could do was to sop up the remaining broth with more of that tasty bread

We had the kale salad, duck confit meatballs and the seared scallops
One of my favorite parts of the meal was the date salad

"dessert was a chocolate type of cake mousse fondant wich was perfect for a chocolate lover!"
Dessert was some kind of cake with rum just poor in it

The chocolate fondue was pretty run of the mill but it had some creme puffs as a dipping options which I liked
I will dream about that chocolate souffle until the day I die_ It was THAT good

For entrees, we had the bone-in pork chop, brick chicken and the scallops & pork belly, and they were all fantastic
We ordered chicken and waffles, steak frites, 1_2 dozen oysters, and cocktails
